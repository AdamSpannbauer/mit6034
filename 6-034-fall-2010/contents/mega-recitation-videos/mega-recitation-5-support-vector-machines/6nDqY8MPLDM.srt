8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,640
PROFESSOR: Hope everyone had
a great Veteran's Day break

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,670
yesterday, spending
it, of course,

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,049
as I check my test audience,
spending it mostly doing

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,050
your [INAUDIBLE]
research or PSETs.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,910
But at least one
person got to watch TV.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,830
So at least one person
got to have a real break,

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,170
and that's something
truly amazing and special.

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,160
So now we're going
to talk about SVMs.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,990
They're pretty much the
hardest thing in 6.034.

17
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,280
However, in recent
years a few shortcuts

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,384
have popped up
that will sometimes

19
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,800
allow you to solve the question,
depending on what they're

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,170
asking for, without solving
some vast ugly set of equations

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,630
with a vast ugly
number of unknowns.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,410
So I'm going to show
that to you guys.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,910
I'm also going to try to
explain all the alphabet

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,620
soup that's in [INAUDIBLE]
and what all the letters stand

25
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:26,260
for because it took me a few
times going through SVMs.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,810
It took me a few times
going through SVMs

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,174
to actually find
out for sure what

28
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:33,340
all those letters stood for.

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,630
And if you guys figure
it out first try,

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,130
that's going to be great, and
you guys will be just fine.

31
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,490
So let's take a look at
the problem that's perhaps

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,470
most optimized for using some
of the shortcuts to solving it

33
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,560
and not putting up
all the equations.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,180
Then I will-- not
because I'm sadistic,

35
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,630
but because I'm being nice,
I will force you with me

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,240
to solve some of the things they
didn't ask for us to solve so

37
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,260
that you can see that
we can't get away

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,680
with everything without doing
some of the harder stuff.

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,770
And of course, definitely
ask questions as always,

40
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,330
but this time even more so.

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,350
You guys, well, if you
were looking around,

42
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,520
you saw nobody in this
entire lecture hall

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,880
raised their hand that they
are already set and ready

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,120
and know SVMs.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,390
So if you have a question,
maybe everybody else does.

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,030
So let's go.

47
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,180
We'll start right here.

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,520
As always, pretend
that I can draw,

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,870
and that therefore all the
pluses and minuses are only

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,105
on integer coordinates.

51
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,620
So we are asked in this problem
to circle the support vectors.

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,020
Draw the edges of the street
and then the dotted line

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,850
in the middle that
separates them,

54
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,940
the separator, as a dashed line.

55
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,140
And then to give w and b.

56
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,920
So what are w and b?

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,300
Well, there's a few
important equations in SVMs

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,924
that we really
hope-- and I'm going

59
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:25,340
to tell you we're lucky in
this because we don't have to--

60
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,910
but we really hope
that we don't have

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,960
to use because they provide
a huge number of variables.

62
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,500
So one of those
crucial equations

63
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:43,190
is that for a plus support
vector, w vector dot x plus,

64
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,095
the plus support
vector, plus b equals 1.

65
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:55,630
w dot x minus plus
b equals minus 1.

66
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,490
And w dot that dotted
line-- I don't know,

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:06,140
we'll call it dot dot
dot-- plus b equals 0.

68
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,410
So what does this mean?

69
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,400
There are a lot of vectors.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,430
Well, I mean, we're usually
in two-dimensional space,

71
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,810
so we can basically
just say that there's

72
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,899
two components of this
w vector, w1 and w2.

73
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,130
And they're just
two coefficients

74
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,810
in a linear equation.

75
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,850
So for instance, what we're
interested in finding,

76
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,690
this dot dot dot
line, we'll just

77
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,920
call that x, so
with nothing on it.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Actually, maybe
that'll be easier.

79
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:44,900
This is equivalent to saying
w1x1 plus w2x2 plus b equals 0,

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,380
where x1 is this,
and x2 is this.

81
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,210
We would possibly
call them x and y.

82
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,690
So one way to think
about it is w1,

83
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:03,200
we'll call it a, ax
plus-- call w2 b-- by.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,890
Oh, don't call it b.

85
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,340
Well, ax plus cy plus b
equals-- I'll put this all in

86
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,740
parentheses-- this is basically
an equation like this.

87
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:29,830
Or y equals negative a
over c x minus b over c.

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,270
It's basically y
equals mx plus b.

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,394
Does everyone see that?

90
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,810
This thing that
we're looking for,

91
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,490
this w dot x plus b
equals 0, is the equation

92
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,440
of a line in
Cartesian coordinates.

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
It just looks uglier.

94
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,320
Normally, when we're doing
all this solving for w and b,

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,790
we would have to put
in tons of equations,

96
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,940
plug in all of the
support vectors in there.

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,220
And we'd have to use these
little devils called alphas.

98
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,280
Alphas essentially--
if it wasn't clear

99
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,650
in the lecture, which it
usually isn't completely

100
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,420
clear to everyone, wasn't clear
to me completely-- alphas,

101
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,120
the way I like to
think about them,

102
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,630
the alphas in this
problem is they

103
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,390
are the weight of how
significant any particular

104
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,280
point on the graph is towards
creating the boundary.

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,845
The higher the
alpha is, the more

106
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:32,210
that that point narrows
in the boundary.

107
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,740
The lower the alpha is, the
less that that point narrows

108
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,570
in the boundary, the
wider the road can be.

109
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,320
And if that point
doesn't do anything,

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,327
if that point is irrelevant
and could be removed

111
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:44,410
and it wouldn't affect the
boundary, the alpha is?

112
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,230
Everyone?

113
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,964
AUDIENCE: Zero.

114
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:46,630
PROFESSOR: Zero.

115
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,940
Well, that was one person, but
you can suffice for everyone.

116
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,060
The alpha is 0.

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,620
And that means if it's not a
support vector, if it's not

118
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,520
one of the vectors on
the boundary lines,

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,210
it will always have an alpha
of 0 because it doesn't affect.

120
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,380
So keeping that in
mind, there's a few fun

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,072
and important
equations about alphas

122
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,030
that we'll need if we're
solving many equations

123
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,990
for many unknowns, which
hopefully we won't have to do.

124
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,380
The sum over the
positive alphas equals

125
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,300
the sum over the alphas--
the negative points.

126
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,530
And this is true
over all the points.

127
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,830
But since all of
the alphas are 0,

128
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,560
except for the support
vectors, it also

129
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,710
means the alphas of
the positive support

130
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,250
vectors are equal to the
alphas of the negative support

131
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,490
vectors.

132
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,070
Additionally, our old
buddy, the w vector,

133
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,450
is equal to the
sum over all i that

134
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:56,800
are plus vectors of wi
alpha i minus m over j

135
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,500
minus vectors of wj alpha j.

136
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,510
Now, all of these equations
can be used in a bloody mess

137
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,110
to figure out the answer to
what we're trying to find,

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,940
which is circles--
well, actually, they

139
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,580
can't be used as
circle support vectors

140
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,820
and draw the dotted line.

141
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,450
But once we do that,
all these equations

142
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,860
can be used in a bloody mess to
give us the next thing that we

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,380
want, which is w and b.

144
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,120
So fortunately, there's
another way to get w and b.

145
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,429
If you guys really want,
at the end of the hour

146
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,080
we can also try to
derive w and b using

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,740
the many equations
in many unknowns,

148
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,200
but it's a bit painful.

149
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,930
We'll try to do it the cool way.

150
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,545
So let's start off.

151
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:51,920
This is the one
we're looking at.

152
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,590
We need to find where
the support vectors are.

153
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,010
So the first thing we need
to do is simply eye it.

154
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,970
Fortunately, on the
test, there will always

155
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,960
be ones that you can
eye if you're supposed

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,850
to circle the support vectors.

157
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,200
There's obviously
some number of pluses

158
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,460
and some number of minuses.

159
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,564
I say obviously, but maybe not.

160
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:12,980
But hopefully
obviously, and we'll

161
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,490
find out because I'm going
to call on random people.

162
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,899
So give me a positive
support vector.

163
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:28,120
AUDIENCE: Um, going to the one
that looked like [INAUDIBLE]?

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,210
PROFESSOR: Which plus
sign, [INAUDIBLE]?

165
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,580
AUDIENCE: One on the right.

166
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,380
PROFESSOR: The one all
the way on the right.

167
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,840
Yeah, that plus sign is a
positive support vector.

168
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,170
That's good.

169
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,920
All right?

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,256
Excellent.

171
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,880
Now, give me a negative
support vector.

172
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,310
That one?

173
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,114
No?

174
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:51,030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

175
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,113
PROFESSOR: Ah, no problem.

176
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,530
Give me a negative
support vector.

177
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,904
AUDIENCE: I should
definitely ask

178
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:56,470
you, what's a support vector?

179
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,955
[LAUGHTER]

180
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,440
PROFESSOR: That is
a good question.

181
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,720
The question is, what
is a support vector?

182
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,600
How many other people will
admit to having this question?

183
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,100
See?

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,225
You're not alone.

185
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:12,725
OK.

186
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,390
Before I go on, I'm going
to assume-- you guys make

187
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,331
sure I'm correct-- Monday
was, just being sure

188
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,580
so I can tailor based on this.

189
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,230
Monday was the support
vector machine lecture.

190
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,470
But it was also very
difficult to follow.

191
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,460
That's what I usually expect.

192
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,170
So what is a support vector?

193
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,350
Well, all these pluses and
minuses, if we were me,

194
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,600
and if, I guess--
yeah, if we were me

195
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,490
and if I was describing this
problem, the one that we work

196
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,970
out in class, I would
call them points

197
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,840
because they're on the graph.

198
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,320
They're points.

199
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,515
They're data points.

200
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:59,240
But however, in more difficult
versions of this problem

201
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,760
that have n
dimensions, where n is

202
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,330
some ridiculous
number of dimensions

203
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,040
that you're never
going to graph.

204
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,310
Like say some of the
research I'm doing now,

205
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,060
I could use support
vector machines

206
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,420
on some of these articles that
I'm reading about cyber events

207
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,520
to try to figure out
if there's a real event

208
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,780
or if it's just someone
complaining about how we're

209
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,540
really vulnerable or
something like that

210
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,550
and no event actually happened.

211
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,820
So the reason why they
call these guys vectors is

212
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,990
when you're not able to graph
them on a Cartesian plane,

213
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,790
there's still this long vector
of many different dimensions.

214
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,750
Right now, though, these
points represent the vectors.

215
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,134
This is very simple.

216
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,550
It's easier to
view them this way.

217
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,685
But for instance, that
plus at negative 1, 2

218
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,060
represents the
fact that there is

219
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,670
a vector going in the
direction of negative 1, 2

220
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,415
with a magnitude such that
it reaches negative 1, 2.

221
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,540
So all these points are
just a point representation

222
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,180
of a vector.

223
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,400
You probably, in any class
that worked with vectors,

224
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,330
saw this, saw vectors being
represented as points.

225
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,830
Question?

226
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:07,865
AUDIENCE: Always from the
respect to the origin?

227
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:08,490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

228
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,680
The question is always
with respect to the origin.

229
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,842
The answer is
canonically, when vectors

230
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:15,340
are represented as
points, yes, it's always

231
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,820
with respect to the origin.

232
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,604
So that's the basic idea is that
all these points are vectors.

233
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:22,770
So what are support vectors?

234
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, you could call them
support points for this case.

235
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,191
But the reason we call
them support vectors

236
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,800
is again, in the
generalized case

237
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,980
that you might be doing in
the real world with real AI,

238
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,480
you're going to
have a giant vector.

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,560
And it's not just going
to be points on a graph.

240
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,850
Well, usually.

241
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,970
So the support vectors,
the support points,

242
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,000
we found one of them correctly.

243
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,660
It's this guy.

244
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,124
They're going to be the
ones that again, they

245
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,290
don't have an alpha of zero.

246
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,740
They're the ones that bind
in the, as Petra calls it,

247
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,780
the road, the boundary lines.

248
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,930
They're going to be
on the edge of plus.

249
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,010
Whichever direction
we draw it, this plus

250
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,616
is the edge of the plus region.

251
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,947
If we made this the
edge of the plus region

252
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,030
and everything on this
side is plus and everything

253
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,710
on this side is
minus, we'd be screwed

254
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,170
because there's two pluses
on the other side of that.

255
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,040
Generally, when trying
to find a support vector,

256
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,100
you do something a little bit
similar to my crazy method

257
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,950
of doing nearest
neighbors, and try

258
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,860
to find a plus-minus pair
that's close to each other.

259
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,650
Sometimes though, it's
not just two points

260
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,900
because sometimes if you try
to draw the simple-minded

261
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,760
thing, which is
the perpendicular

262
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,780
bisector of the two points,
you get screwed because there's

263
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,800
another point in your way.

264
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
So now that I've
given away a clue,

265
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,722
let's go-- and hopefully
that made sense to you guys.

266
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:50,805
The support vectors are
the ones on the edges that

267
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:53,320
are just barely a plus
for sure, or just barely

268
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,390
a minus for sure.

269
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,040
Let's go back.

270
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,900
Can you give me a
negative support vector?

271
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,852
AUDIENCE: The top one?

272
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:58,477
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

273
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,055
AUDIENCE: The top
negative point?

274
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:02,380
PROFESSOR: The one
on the top left?

275
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:02,880
Yes.

276
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,630
And does anyone think that
there's a third support vector?

277
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,420
Well, let's simple-mindedly
try the thing that-- remember,

278
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,160
support vectors
always attempt to have

279
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,470
the widest possible space
between the pluses and minuses

280
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,600
that they can.

281
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,240
So let's simple-mindedly try to
do the perpendicular bisector

282
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,380
and see if screws us over.

283
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,050
So when we simple-mindedly do
the perpendicular bisector,

284
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:39,330
it goes through here like this.

285
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,665
And it's just fine.

286
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,415
So these are the only
two support vectors.

287
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,490
And there's our divider line.

288
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,210
So we're on the home stretch.

289
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,160
But we have to find w and b.

290
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,160
In olden days, we would find
w and b by plugging in w dot

291
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,130
the plus support
vector, plus b equals 1.

292
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,600
Oh, that's very crucial.

293
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,800
These w dot x plus
x minus are only

294
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,780
true equaling 1 or negative 1?

295
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,540
Or only true for
support vectors?

296
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,630
It's always true that w dot
any positive point plus b will

297
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,520
be some positive number.

298
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,730
But it won't always be 1.

299
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,870
In fact, it will always be
greater than 1 up over here.

300
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,275
It will always be less
than -1 down over there.

301
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,330
In olden days, we would plug
in -1, 2 into this equation.

302
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,670
We would plug in 3,
-2 into this equation.

303
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,557
We'd plug in alpha plus equals
alpha minus in its sums.

304
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,140
And since there's
only 1 plus 1 minus,

305
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,030
we'd know they were equal.

306
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,440
And then we'd fidget around
with this w equation.

307
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
However, there is a
better way to do it.

308
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
And so let's use
this cheap strategy

309
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,310
to solve this
version of the SVM.

310
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,180
Here's how.

311
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,730
First, and I know I didn't
draw these completely straight.

312
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,030
Sorry.

313
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,060
But can anyone, by looking
at-- this is three, -2.

314
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,150
2 And this is -1, 2.

315
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,680
Can anyone tell me what
the equation-- you can do y

316
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,720
equals mx plus b.

317
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,011
Can anyone tell me what the
equation of the dotted line

318
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:40,354
is supposed to be if
I was good at drawing?

319
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,764
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

320
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:46,138
PROFESSOR: People say
y equals x minus 1.

321
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:50,100
And I say yes, y
equals x minus 1.

322
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,800
So therefore, the
pluses would be

323
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,330
y is greater than or
equal to x minus 1 indeed.

324
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,710
So we've already seen that
w dot x plus b somehow can

325
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,640
be converted into this form.

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Right?

327
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,730
So therefore, if we
have y equals x minus 1,

328
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:19,490
then we know that we have we
have w dot x plus b equals 0.

329
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,250
Let's do that here.

330
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:28,730
So we know that w1 x1.

331
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,450
We can even call it x and y.

332
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,170
I think it'll be fine.

333
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,720
No one will come after us.

334
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,160
w2 y plus b equals 0.

335
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,770
But we also know that
y equals x minus 1,

336
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:48,060
which means that if
y equals x minus 1,

337
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,310
then according to this
thing we have over here,

338
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,915
then negative w1
over w2 equals--

339
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:12,340
So we know that negative w1 over
w2-- and we have -b over w2.

340
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,960
So y equals x minus 1.

341
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,330
And if we solve this equation
to make it look like this,

342
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:29,220
we would have y equals negative
w1 over w2 Minus b over w2.

343
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:37,920
So we know that in some way,
shape, or form-- we know that

344
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,100
then therefore, w1
over w2 is some scalar

345
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,900
multiple of minus 1.

346
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,280
And we know that b over w2
is, in fact, some scalar

347
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,910
multiple of positive 1.

348
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,660
Scalar multiple, what's
a scalar multiple?

349
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,410
Well, why is it a
scalar multiple?

350
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,520
Why isn't it just going to
be negative 1 or positive 1?

351
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,530
Just because in
this equation, we

352
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,284
can multiply the entire
equation by any number

353
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,200
and it will still have
the same boundary line.

354
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,255
You guys see that?

355
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,320
Oh, there's an x here.

356
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,170
If we multiplied everything,
since it's all divided by w2.

357
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,310
If we double w2, but
also doubled b and w1,

358
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,125
it would be the
exact same equation.

359
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,010
Do you guys agree?

360
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,356
So there's, in fact, infinitely
many possible equations.

361
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,480
You say, well, great, Mark.

362
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,450
You've figured out
what form it is.

363
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,260
So you figured out
that w1 over w2

364
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,040
equals some scalar
multiple of negative 1.

365
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,600
So it's negative
1 times-- what's

366
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,446
everyone's favorite letter?

367
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:56,179
AUDIENCE: k.

368
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:56,720
PROFESSOR: k.

369
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,440
Negative 1 times k.

370
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,180
And we figured out
that b over w2 is--

371
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,320
I guess we can just do
negative -- is positive k.

372
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,000
But what's k?

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,416
How are we going
to figure it out?

374
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,600
Well, it's a good question.

375
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
And I will tell you how.

376
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,090
I will assert the following
fact as true without proof.

377
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,320
Then I will not prove it.

378
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,640
1 over the magnitude of w,
which is this vector here

379
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,300
with w1 and w2,
equals this where

380
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,720
this is that line that I
just drew, the line from here

381
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,870
to this point.

382
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,840
1 over the magnitude
of w equals this.

383
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,970
Therefore, since 1 over the
magnitude of w equals this,

384
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,250
and this equals, I
believe, 2 root 2,

385
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,550
because we're going
over to, down to,

386
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,200
Pythagorean Theorem, 2, root 2.

387
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,760
So therefore, flip
everything over.

388
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,740
Magnitude of w equals
1 over 2 root 2.

389
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,430
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals root 2 over 4.

390
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,130
But why are we OK?

391
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,900
Well, how do we calculate
the magnitude of w?

392
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,560
Do people know, in general,
magnitudes of vectors?

393
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,720
Generally, for these
vectors, we do it

394
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,990
by the square root of the sum
of the components squared.

395
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:49,290
So the square root of w1
squared plus w2 squared

396
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,300
equals root 2 over 4.

397
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,610
But that's not all.

398
00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:00,710
That's not all, we say, because
we know from this over here

399
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,412
that the ratio of w1 and w2 is--

400
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:07,090
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

401
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:13,900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
ratio of w1 and w2

402
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,340
is going to be--
actually, sorry.

403
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,150
I shouldn't put a k here.

404
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,490
I realize I probably have
been confusing you guys a lot.

405
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,475
w1 over w2 is just -1.

406
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:27,510
B Over w2 is just 1.

407
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,570
That's just a fact.

408
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,600
There's no k.

409
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,630
The k is to determine
what w1 and w2 are.

410
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,403
So w1 equals -k.

411
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:41,760
And w2 equals positive k.

412
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,156
And b equals also positive k.

413
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,790
By the way, here's
a question for you.

414
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,830
Could I have put the
negative sign on w2 and b

415
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,860
instead of on w1?

416
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,970
So many people said yes.

417
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,250
That's a very smart answer.

418
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,080
Actually, no,
because of the fact

419
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,270
that the pluses are on
the negative x-axis.

420
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,402
It's just a little
trick I picked up.

421
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,902
When one of them is negative
and the other one isn't, follow

422
00:23:13,902 --> 00:23:15,400
the pluses.

423
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,620
So we know that w1 is
-k, w2 is positive k,

424
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,196
and b Is positive k.

425
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:22,455
w1 over w2 is -1.

426
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:24,700
b over w2 is positive 1.

427
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,460
So what do we know about
the ratio of w1 and w2?

428
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,720
It's equal to -1.

429
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,810
And that means that
when we square it,

430
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,290
w1 squared equals w2 squared.

431
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,720
So therefore, this
is the square root

432
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,540
of 2 w1 squared, which
equals root 2 w1.

433
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,460
Well, actually no, it
doesn't equal root 2 w1

434
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,340
because w1 is actually negative.

435
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,420
So it's negative root 2 w1.

436
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,430
It doesn't matter.

437
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:09,100
The point is that if that
equals root 2 over 4,

438
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,042
then w1 is-- everyone?

439
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,000
AUDIENCE: Negative 1/4.

440
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,210
PROFESSOR: Negative 1/4.

441
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,042
Bingo.

442
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:18,690
And if w1 is -1/4, 1 everything
else falls into place.

443
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,630
What are w2 and b?

444
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,460
Everyone?

445
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,600
AUDIENCE: Positive 1/4.

446
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,720
PROFESSOR: Positive 1/4.

447
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
We got it.

448
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
We're done with this
part of problem.

449
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,210
However, bonus.

450
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,800
Let's come to the
alphas, which they

451
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,420
didn't ask you to calculate.

452
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,719
Actually, you know what?

453
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,510
We'll do the alphas if
we have enough time,

454
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,718
since they didn't actually
ask you to calculate them.

455
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:38,240
However, my recommendation
is since there's only

456
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
one alpha-plus and
one alpha-minus,

457
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,570
they must be equal
from this equation,

458
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,010
since the sum of the alpha-plus
equals the sum of alpha-minus.

459
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:54,030
And so therefore, w equals
the sum of w-- sorry,

460
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,520
this should be an x.

461
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,980
Of course, there's not a
million w's in this equation.

462
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,912
The sum of the positive data
points times their alpha

463
00:25:02,912 --> 00:25:05,490
is minus the negative data
points times their alphas.

464
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:14,550
So we're looking at here
-1/4, 1/4 equals-- what

465
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,180
do we got here?

466
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,110
Positive point negative 1, 2?

467
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:27,020
So we've got alpha, alpha of
that point negative 1, 2 minus

468
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,750
alpha of that minus point.

469
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,890
And what is that?

470
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,790
It's 3, -2.

471
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,690
3, -2.

472
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,370
So if both of the alphas
which are equal were 1,

473
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,440
we'd have -4, 4.

474
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,220
But we want -1/4, 1/4.

475
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:53,070
So actually both of
the alphas are 1/16.

476
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,340
And that's the answer.

477
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,370
We'll do that more in
depth if we have time.

478
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,300
But we won't.

479
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,530
So let's do number two.

480
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,550
So let's go into faster mode.

481
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,780
Number two, very similar
to number one in many ways.

482
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,680
But as you can see, one of the
main things that they added

483
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,800
an extra minus sign at 2, -1.

484
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,890
So I think we can all
agree that this will still

485
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,560
be our plus-- Actually, they
added another plus sign there,

486
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,470
too.

487
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,060
So maybe this plus sign
is a support vector.

488
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,870
But it's not.

489
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,496
This plus sign is
a support vector.

490
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:28,620
What do you guys think
about the new negative sign?

491
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,100
Will it become a support
vector since it is strictly

492
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,370
closer to the pluses?

493
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,460
Yep, you're right.

494
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,080
OK, so this is a very
beautiful division

495
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,580
because if I do this correctly,
which I didn't, but if we

496
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,980
pretend that I did.

497
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,445
Then the dotted line is--

498
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:49,840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

499
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,805
PROFESSOR: y equals x.

500
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,780
OK, so with the dotted
line at y equals x, then

501
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:11,800
just like we did up here, we
know that if y equals x plus 0,

502
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,700
we know that first
of all, b equals 0.

503
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:22,550
Second of all, we know
that if y equals x, then

504
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,940
we know that -w1
over w2 equals 1.

505
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,910
The pluses are still
on the left and up,

506
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,364
so we know that w1 is
some negative number, -k,

507
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:43,580
and w2 is some
positive number k.

508
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,390
Great.

509
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,480
How are we going
to figure it out?

510
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,020
Well, let's call
this d for distance,

511
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,710
or whatever you want to call it.

512
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,300
So 1 over w equals d.

513
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,860
d In this case is not 2 over 2.

514
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,270
Can everyone tell
what d is here?

515
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

516
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,700
PROFESSOR: It's actually--
so it goes over 2 and 1.

517
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:23,820
So it should be 1 1/2 root
2 since this width distance,

518
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,420
which is twice as much,
goes over 3 and 3,

519
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,650
which is 3 root 2.

520
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,780
So it's 1 1/2 root 2.

521
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,170
I don't like putting in
decimals and stuff there.

522
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,820
So we'll say that 2
over magnitude of w

523
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:45,630
equals 2d equals 3 root 2.

524
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,510
So therefore, right,
Pythagorean, one, two, three,

525
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,310
one, two, three, 3 root 2.

526
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:59,300
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals-- let's see.

527
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,040
Switch them over.

528
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,330
We should get root 2 over 3.

529
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:07,230
And if magnitude of
w is root 2 over 3,

530
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,420
we can do our same
trick from before,

531
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,630
square root of 2 w2 squared
equals root 2 over 3.

532
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,250
And this is just root 2 times
w2 equals root 2 over 3.

533
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,650
So therefore, w2 is?

534
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,240
1/3.

535
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,430
And w1 is?

536
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,250
-1/3.

537
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,370
Bingo.

538
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,730
We've got w1.

539
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,980
We've got w2.

540
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,960
We know that b was zero
because obviously it's 0.

541
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,300
It's y equals x.

542
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,940
And we're done.

543
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,040
That was fast.

544
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,340
The alphas might taken longer.

545
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,923
Actually, the alphas on this one
are more of a pain in the ass

546
00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:51,030
than anywhere else because
let's take a look at this one

547
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,770
if you can see it.

548
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,850
We've added in yet
some new points.

549
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,100
We've got this point up here
and this point down there.

550
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,640
So I think pretty clearly
this plus and minus

551
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,906
are the closest to each other.

552
00:30:01,906 --> 00:30:03,780
But what happens if we
take the perpendicular

553
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:09,200
bisector between these
two and do like this?

554
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,194
This plus is in the middle.

555
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,860
So therefore, this
plus is going to have

556
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,540
to also be a support vector.

557
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,090
So we can't just draw this line.

558
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,810
We have to include this.

559
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,040
What's our best division?

560
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,800
Vertical lines, that's right.

561
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:34,252
Vertical lines just so.

562
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:39,100
And that means that the
equation of our boundary,

563
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,085
the dotted line here, y-axis.

564
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,695
So the equation of the boundary
with the y-axis, then b

565
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:50,770
equals 0.

566
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,490
And hell, w2 equals 0.

567
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,860
So the only thing that is not--

568
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,770
AUDIENCE: Wait, w1 [INAUDIBLE].

569
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,077
PROFESSOR: w2 equals 0.

570
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,560
So w2 equals 0.

571
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,490
b equals 0.

572
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:12,420
But w1 is not equal to
zero because it's just

573
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,070
the equation of the y-axis.

574
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:21,270
So we therefore know
that the equation is just

575
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,980
w1 times x equals 0.

576
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,400
So it's w1 times x equals 0.

577
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,470
And we know that that
just means essentially

578
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:39,777
that x is going to be some k.

579
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:41,860
It's also going to be
negative because of the fact

580
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,400
that the pluses are
still on the left.

581
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,610
Then we're going to have to
figure out what that k is.

582
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:51,500
We'll use our old trick-- by
this point old, hopefully.

583
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,060
One over magnitude
of w equals d.

584
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,280
This time d is just 1.

585
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,050
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals 1.

586
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,450
There's only one component in w.

587
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,000
So therefore w1 is

588
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,360
AUDIENCE: -1.

589
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,330
PROFESSOR: -1 because
the plus is on the left.

590
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,900
Do people see that?

591
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,810
Not too bad.

592
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,563
This one's easy to
calculate the w.

593
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:20,460
But it's not as easy
to get all the alphas.

594
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,740
But let's move on to
a new and even more

595
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,920
fun-- maybe not-- question,
which is this guy.

596
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,100
As you can see-- well maybe not.

597
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,960
This is a one
dimensional vector.

598
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,970
These vectors only have
a single dimension.

599
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,380
So it just looks like
a number line here.

600
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,610
That dimension varies from it
looks like -9 to positive 9.

601
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,247
It just has one component.

602
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,705
You don't have to worry about
any of these crazy magnitudes

603
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:53,530
with two components,
just everything

604
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,100
as a single component.

605
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,300
However, it's obvious
that a linear basis

606
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,890
line is going to completely
screw us up here,

607
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,090
since lines at this point
are just like, grunk,

608
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,024
all these are pluses.

609
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:06,940
All these are minuses.

610
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,860
Well, great, that
doesn't get them all.

611
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,570
So how are we going to do it?

612
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:13,180
Well, we're going to use what
is usually perhaps the hardest

613
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
thing in SVMs, but
in this case is not

614
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,010
going to be too bad for us.

615
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,520
We're going to use a kernel.

616
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,160
Now, based on how little
I understood kernels

617
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,320
the first time I
took this class,

618
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,970
I'm guessing that
you guys would like

619
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,714
to have some explanation
on these kernels.

620
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:31,630
You probably saw them.

621
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,070
You remember the kernels from
Patrick's lecture vaguely?

622
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,120
There's this phi.

623
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,160
And then there's this k.

624
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,730
And then they get
really complicated.

625
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,420
OK, so here's how
the kernel works.

626
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,660
The basic idea is this.

627
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,420
And I'll write it over here.

628
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,030
Oh, wow, there's more stuff.

629
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,739
OK.

630
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:54,780
I'll write it right here.

631
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,730
The basic idea is this.

632
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,910
We're taking the normal space,
which is this number line

633
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,100
or it could be any
kind of normal space,

634
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
and we're going
to take a vector,

635
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,230
we're going to put into
it a function called phi.

636
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,120
And phi of vector x brings
x into some new dimension.

637
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,659
Phi, or "phee" if
you like it better,

638
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,400
is usually a nasty piece
of work and something

639
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,929
you never, ever want to look at.

640
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,820
Sometimes it's not too bad.

641
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,679
Phi is the function that brings
it into the new dimension.

642
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,224
OK?

643
00:34:29,224 --> 00:34:31,570
And when you brought the
data into a new dimension,

644
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,070
sometimes you can just cut a
straight line in that dimension

645
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,699
and you'll just be happy.

646
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:42,159
However, something
that was noted

647
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,449
by the very, very smart inventor
of support vector machines

648
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:54,710
is that you don't actually
need to work with function phi,

649
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,740
even if phi is an absolutely
horrible monstrosity, because

650
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,850
of the fact that you never need
to know what all these vectors

651
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,400
x actually are in the new
space, at least not directly.

652
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,930
In none of these
equations up here

653
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,720
do we ever use x by itself.

654
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,440
However, we do use x being dot
product with something else.

655
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,780
So he figured out a very
sneaky and excellent shortcut.

656
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,510
OK, so-- oh, I
shouldn't use x1 and x2.

657
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,530
I'll use x and z.

658
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,910
So if you have two
vectors, x and z, which

659
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,140
are in a regular
space, you put them

660
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,650
into this function
called the kernel.

661
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:55,120
Then it will tell you
phi x dotted with phi z.

662
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,920
And if you have that,
you don't need phi.

663
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,934
Does everyone see that?

664
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,600
Does everyone see why
we don't need phi?

665
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,099
Look at all these
equations up here.

666
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,770
We have never looked
at x by itself

667
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,390
in these vector
equations at least.

668
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,610
Now, calculating alphas, yeah,
that gets a little bit fuzzy.

669
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,240
Also, you may ask,
why would you do this?

670
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,720
You can't calculate the alphas.

671
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,200
It turns out that actually,
other than for these very

672
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,800
simple linear problems,
human minds cannot calculate

673
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,740
the alphas.

674
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,827
In fact, you run
a very complicated

675
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:36,785
quadratic optimization.

676
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:39,090
In fact, finding
out the best alphas

677
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,720
is the thing that you
hill climb on when you're

678
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,440
doing SVMs in the real world.

679
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,075
You say, all right,
I'll run my algorithm

680
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,770
when I know there's
only one peak, which

681
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,430
is very, very good because
it's quadratic optimization.

682
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,080
Let me figure out the alphas.

683
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,010
So in fact, it doesn't
matter that you

684
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:00,359
can't use these alpha equations
to figure out the alphas if you

685
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,900
only know the kernel
function and not

686
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,280
the phi function because
normally, the computer

687
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,166
figures out the alphas for you
with quadratic optimization.

688
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,540
Just in these
simple problems, we

689
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,400
know you can
calculate the alphas.

690
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,120
So we have the kernel,
which basically gives us

691
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,500
the dot product of the
things in the new space.

692
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,200
So being that as it may, I'll
give you the kernel here.

693
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,410
I'd like you give me phi.

694
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,670
Someone got an idea, whose
name was Susan Q. Random

695
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,360
Student, apparently.

696
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,980
She got an idea that if we had
a kernel for x and z-- actually,

697
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,210
they're not vectors, I guess.

698
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,430
There just single components.

699
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:55,500
And the kernel equals cosine Pi
over 4x times cosine Pi over 4

700
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:07,260
z plus sine Pi over 4x
plus sine Pi over 4z.

701
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,670
So that is the new dot product.

702
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,090
Oh, wait, sorry.

703
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,030
I put one of the z's not
inside the parentheses.

704
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,340
That was silly of me.

705
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:28,220
So cosine of the
quantity pi Over 4x times

706
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,300
cosine of the quantity Pi over
4z plus sine of quantity Pi

707
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,480
over 4x plus sine of quantity
Pi over 4z is the new product.

708
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,910
So that begs the question.

709
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,150
This is an easy one so
we can calculate the phi.

710
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:47,620
What is phi of x?

711
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,025
We're actually taking
it from one dimension

712
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:53,890
and we may be playing around
with it a lot to get this.

713
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,910
And this thing has
become a new dot product.

714
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,532
It replaces dot product.

715
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:00,240
And remember, the dot
product for scalars

716
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,750
would have just been multiplying
two numbers together.

717
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,000
So it actually makes it a
little bit more complicated.

718
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,650
Does anyone think
they know the phi?

719
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:08,930
Oh, we got one.

720
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,896
What do you think?

721
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:10,888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

722
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,228
PROFESSOR: You mean two common
vectors, two dimensional?

723
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,540
AUDIENCE: The two points.

724
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,040
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

725
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,550
That's exactly correct.

726
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:25,310
How would you have solved
this on the actual quiz

727
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,900
if you're not our
brave volunteer?

728
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,330
Well, that k, if you squint at
it-- not very much actually--

729
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:40,200
is pretty much a dot product
between cosine of Pi over 4

730
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,570
and sine Pi over 4.

731
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,070
I mean, look at it.

732
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:48,310
Remember, if the dot
product of x and z vectors

733
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:56,550
is x1, z1 plus x2, z2-- so that
basically is x1, z1 plus x2 z2.

734
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,490
Oh, this should
have been a times.

735
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,190
Yeah, this should
have been a times.

736
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,770
Sorry.

737
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,090
There's a plus there.

738
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,807
Anyone who missed it
because of that, my bad.

739
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,140
That's should have been a times.

740
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,080
That should have been
a times up there.

741
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,580
It's cosine Pi over 4x cosine
Pi over 4z plus sine Pi

742
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,260
over 4x times sine Pi over 4z.

743
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,040
So yeah, it's basically
the dot product

744
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,420
between cosine Pi over
4x and sine Pi over 4x.

745
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,930
Bingo.

746
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,177
All right, last thing.

747
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:26,010
Well, we're not done
yet because we're going

748
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,399
to maybe ask some questions.

749
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,940
And then we're going to see if
we can calculate those alphas.

750
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,850
But last thing, let's
graph in this new dimension

751
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,610
all the points.

752
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:40,330
So obviously, cosines
and sines, so we're

753
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:44,050
going to get results
between 1 and -1.

754
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:44,550
Let's see.

755
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:52,280
Maybe I can graph it--
did I write on all these?

756
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,060
Wait, maybe this one.

757
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,730
No, people drew weird
stick figures there.

758
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,230
OK.

759
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:06,550
Oh, yeah, this
one's kind of messy.

760
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,980
But we'll do it on this.

761
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:26,400
OK, so this is 1, -1, 1/2,
-1/2, 1, -1, -1/2, 1/2.

762
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,460
OK?

763
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,140
So given that,
let's try to graph

764
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,110
all these points
on this number line

765
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:38,740
into this brave new dimension
by using their cosine times

766
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,830
Pi over 4.

767
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,660
So all right, great.

768
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,920
So let's do the pluses first.

769
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,110
The plus at 0 is
cosine 0, sine 0.

770
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,170
So what is that?

771
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,202
AUDIENCE: 1, 0.

772
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:54,160
PROFESSOR: That's 1, 0.

773
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,790
That's right.

774
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:08,140
In fact, the 8 and the
-8 are also that times 3.

775
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,340
The 8 and the -8 are also
that because then it's

776
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,300
just 2 Pi minus 2 Pi, which both
cosine and sine are periodic.

777
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,740
OK, great.

778
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,600
What about the 1?

779
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,130
Well, that's cosine Pi
over 4, sine Pi over 4.

780
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:22,015
And what's that?

781
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,700
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

782
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's root
2 over 2, root 2 over 2.

783
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,950
So that's something
like here, we'll say.

784
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:42,320
And in fact, and the 9
and the -7 are also that.

785
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,570
So there's three of these two.

786
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,640
What about the -1?

787
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,554
That's cosine negative pi
over 4, sine Pi over 4.

788
00:42:55,422 --> 00:42:57,040
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

789
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
PROFESSOR: That's right.

790
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,780
The x value is
positive root 2 over 2.

791
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,660
And the y value is negative.

792
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,070
And again, there's
three of them.

793
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,520
All right, great.

794
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,910
Now let's do the minuses.

795
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,840
There's the minus
at 3, which is also

796
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,110
the same as the minus at -7.

797
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:20,260
The minus at 3 is cosine 3
Pi over 4, sine 3 Pi over 4.

798
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,035
Which one is that?

799
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

800
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's going
to be in the second quadrant.

801
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,010
The cosine is going
to be negative.

802
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,870
But the sine is
going to be positive.

803
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:44,260
And so we get 3 points here.

804
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,730
And as you may have predicted,
the other one, the 5 Pi over 4,

805
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,980
is in the third quadrant.

806
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,044
We get 3 points here, Where
are the support vectors?

807
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:03,304
AUDIENCE: Question.

808
00:44:03,304 --> 00:44:04,756
PROFESSOR: Question?

809
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:06,934
AUDIENCE: I understand
where you're

810
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,418
getting at the three
quantities of pluses

811
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:11,314
in the first of the quadrants.

812
00:44:11,314 --> 00:44:13,684
But according to the
[INAUDIBLE] line there,

813
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,959
you want that the total of
four-- maybe the values.

814
00:44:15,959 --> 00:44:17,125
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right.

815
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,795
There's only two.

816
00:44:18,795 --> 00:44:20,250
Good call.

817
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,739
There's two negatives here.

818
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:23,030
And there's two negatives here.

819
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,700
Good call.

820
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,977
It doesn't change the problem.

821
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:27,560
In fact, if we just
graph more points,

822
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,684
there might have been more.

823
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:30,940
But that's a very subtle
and important distinction.

824
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,860
There are two negatives.

825
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,780
But otherwise, yeah, these
are graphed correctly.

826
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,714
Does anyone see where
the support vectors are?

827
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:42,199
AUDIENCE: The first two.

828
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:44,187
AUDIENCE: Maybe the top two.

829
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:46,449
PROFESSOR:So the top
two, the minus and plus.

830
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,240
We'll try to do the
perpendicular bisector.

831
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,460
Let's see it.

832
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,100
That works.

833
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,880
But guess what?

834
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,700
These guys are on the same line.

835
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,350
So we'd better circle them.

836
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,410
So actually, the question is
what isn't a support vector?

837
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,170
Only this.

838
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,050
Only those three.

839
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:06,997
Question?

840
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:09,496
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you have
just done this in one dimension?

841
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:14,406
I mean, you just showed that
those ran on the same lines.

842
00:45:14,406 --> 00:45:16,861
So you really didn't need the
cosine term and a sine term.

843
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,314
You could have proved all
this with just the cosine.

844
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:20,730
PROFESSOR: All
right, the question

845
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,840
is couldn't we have done
this in one dimension.

846
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,800
All we do is only the cosine.

847
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,910
So if we did only
the cosine, then they

848
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,470
would've still been
easily divisible.

849
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,650
The answer is,
absolutely, we could have.

850
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,170
However, the question did not
because Susan Q. Random Student

851
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,950
decided to do cosine and sine.

852
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,740
But yes, if we had said
you, [INAUDIBLE] student,

853
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,940
find a phi that
will work for this,

854
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,230
you could have found a
phi that was just cosine.

855
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,860
That would have been easier.

856
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,930
However, it's important to
be a little work with what

857
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:57,930
somebody else gives you.

858
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:01,634
In this case, they gave you
that transformation, which yeah,

859
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,175
was wasteful with
an extra dimension.

860
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,630
You didn't need the
sine because you didn't

861
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,240
need the y-axis really here.

862
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,235
You just needed the x.

863
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,030
Does everyone see
this, how this works?

864
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,970
You can maybe
transform dimensions?

865
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,542
The main hardest part is
they'll usually give you a k

866
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,850
and ask for a phi or give
you a phi and ask for a k.

867
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,700
But it's not too bad.

868
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,520
Just remember, if
they give you a phi,

869
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,190
do a dot product with it.

870
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,650
And if they give
you a phi that's

871
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,820
just one component, dot
product of one component,

872
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,290
just multiply them together.

873
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:34,930
Easy enough.

874
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:37,994
If they give you a k,
treat it as a dot product

875
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:39,160
and try to reverse engineer.

876
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,784
It's usually something
like this that's

877
00:46:40,784 --> 00:46:42,200
easy to reverse engineer.

878
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,240
I really haven't seen
it where it's not.

879
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,370
So it often looks like
the scariest problem.

880
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,690
But it's usually not too bad
to go between phis and k's.

881
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,660
Does anyone have any
questions on anything

882
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,646
that we did on support
vector machines?

883
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:01,594
Question.

884
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:04,029
AUDIENCE: So what's the
intuition behind the w?

885
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,451
We solved it and figured
out numbers and integrations

886
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:06,951
with it.

887
00:47:06,951 --> 00:47:08,671
But what is it in relation to--

888
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,420
PROFESSOR: Question
is, what is intuition?

889
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,976
What is w?

890
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:14,980
W Is the dividing line.

891
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,996
It is the drop
dead dividing line.

892
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:18,620
When I say the drop
dead dividing line,

893
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,960
you like those big, bold
solid lines over there.

894
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,680
Those are your
pretty certain lines.

895
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,057
Everything past
that was a minus.

896
00:47:25,057 --> 00:47:26,640
In your training,
it's that everything

897
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,150
past the big bold line there was
a plus in your training stuff.

898
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,290
But the dotted line is
the one you're really

899
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,350
going to use in the test data.

900
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,770
In the test data, when
push comes to shove,

901
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,910
you might get something if
it's inside of that gutter.

902
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,879
And if it's on the,
say, of that one

903
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:44,420
up there, if it's on the upper
left side of that dotted line,

904
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,040
you're going to call it a plus.

905
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,870
So that dotted line is
your decision boundary.

906
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:54,010
And that is basically the idea.

907
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,952
And in fact, the way that
the algorithm would do it

908
00:47:56,952 --> 00:47:58,660
on the computer is it
would quadratically

909
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,430
optimize the alphas,
which messes around

910
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,610
with the dotted line.

911
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,230
And by quadratically
maximizing the alphas-- you see

912
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:07,884
how the alphas add up to a w.

913
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:08,925
It just checks it around.

914
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:12,519
And eventually, it finds, oh,
making the alpha of this one 0

915
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,810
makes it a better optimization.

916
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,980
You're trying to get the
widest possible road.

917
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,715
It would eventually
come out to this.

918
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,340
This is trivial for
a human to eyeball.

919
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,500
But some real
problems with 200 data

920
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,720
points that have to get one or
two of them wrong, classified,

921
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,960
and you may be using a
quadratic kernel or something

922
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,500
that, you can't do that.

923
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,510
You just can't.

924
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,930
Well, maybe can,
in which case you

925
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,782
should be getting a
MacArthur Fellowship

926
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:35,740
or something like that.

927
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,310
But the computer can.

928
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,680
And the basic idea is
when it comes down to it,

929
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,860
it figures out the alphas, that
the best w for the widest road.

930
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,410
And the w s your
decision boundary.

931
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,620
Good question.

932
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,270
Any other questions about
our old friend, SVM?

933
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,250
I have a question for you.

934
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,090
After seeing this-- and
let's pretend that they only

935
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:01,065
asked to solve for w's, b's,
these kind of kernels and phi,

936
00:49:01,065 --> 00:49:03,810
which are the typical
things-- how many people now

937
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:10,030
think that you can go through
and work an SVM problem?

938
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,270
All right, we've got a few.

939
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,250
We've got a happy few.

940
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,150
Band of brothers.

941
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,980
Maybe eight people
raised their hand there.

942
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,010
That's good.

943
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,630
How many people know what
a support vector is now?

944
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,635
That's really good.

945
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,410
Because if that's all
you learned from today's

946
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:32,300
recitation, it's still good.

947
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,130
It really is.

948
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,800
I'm telling you.

949
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,360
I had to take two classes on
this and then TA it before I

950
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,800
really, really understood it.

951
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,660
So you guys are ahead of me.

952
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,790
All right, take care.

953
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,340
Have a great weekend.

954
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,390
And we'll see you for boosting
and vampires next week.

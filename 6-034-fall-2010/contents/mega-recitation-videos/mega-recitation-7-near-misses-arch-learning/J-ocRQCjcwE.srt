8
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:25,480
PROFESSOR: Here we have a
near miss learning tree.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,220
It's a little bit different
but a little bit similar.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,440
We've got different types.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,060
We're trying to learn about
different light sources.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,300
So we're concerned about
different lamps, flashlights,

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,620
all sorts of things.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,770
So these guys can have had types
of support, a base or wires.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,400
The base can be flat,
clamped, or have legs.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,440
The legs can be flat
bottomed or wheeled.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,030
The light source can be
incandescent, fluorescent,

18
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,270
or sodium vapor.

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,780
And the energy
source that powers it

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,410
can be electric,
battery, oil, or gas.

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,350
So there's also
some other things.

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,840
But these are the trees
that we might be climbing up

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,840
with the climb-tree heuristic.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,050
Our starting model is we
have an incandescent bulb.

25
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,870
The height is equal
to 24 inches exactly.

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,840
They have a flat base.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,500
There's electricity to power it.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,350
And it has a shade.

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,820
So our starting model is
basically like a table lamp

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,230
that you set on the table.

31
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,890
It's got the shade
over the top of it.

32
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,250
You know, the standard
room table lamp

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,930
is our starting model.

34
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,840
So recall in arch
learning, which

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,030
is what we are using here, that
there are several heuristics

36
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,110
that we might want to use.

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:49,930
Let's see, well, the
heuristics are-- we've

38
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:58,765
got require-link, forbid-link.

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:17,600
We've got climb-tree,
extend-set, close-interval.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:34,570
And we also have drop-link--
forgot about that one.

41
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,130
That's sort of with the links.

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,880
I can put it here.

43
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:47,910
OK, so if you want to do
well on these questions

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,680
if they appear on the
final, first of all,

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,070
you better know what
those six heuristics do.

46
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:04,330
So basically require-link
is a heuristic.

47
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,000
It goes into your
model as a requirement,

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,450
where before your
model just didn't care.

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,240
So let's say there was something
about color for your light,

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,970
like for your lamp's
base or for the lamp.

51
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,850
And right, now it doesn't
care about color at all.

52
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,370
But let's say that you wound
up having an example that was,

53
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,130
for instance, blue or white
or whatever these colors are.

54
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:43,610
And it wound up getting that
blue was OK for-- in its model,

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,410
it wound up getting, OK,
blue and white are OK.

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,790
Or actually, no, an even
more basic example--

57
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,590
let's say that it just kept
getting blue lamps as examples,

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,760
and all of them were blue.

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,218
And it just didn't care about
the fact that they were blue.

60
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:00,420
But they did turn
out to be blue.

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,060
And then eventually
it found a red one

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,780
that was exactly the
same as its model,

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,320
but the red one was a near miss.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,840
Then it might
require blue, which

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,110
was already an acceptable,
permissible thing in its model.

66
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,050
But it could be required.

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,899
Now, another thing
it can do is forbid.

68
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,990
Some people ask me, why
would you bother saying,

69
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,500
forbid red, say, if you can
already just require blue?

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,940
Together they cover
the same ground.

71
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,110
The answer is because this
system, this arch learning

72
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,870
system-- remember, it's
Patrick's doctoral thesis.

73
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,560
It's an old system.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,200
Because it was
built on old systems

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,410
and because also it's
generally a good idea,

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,902
it was very parsimonious.

77
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's say you had
a set of colors--

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,440
red, blue, yellow, green,
pink, purple, orange--

79
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,080
and you found that only orange
was giving you problems,

80
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,800
you could try to require
that it be in this.

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,810
Or you could even
use extend-set,

82
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,060
make a giant set of red, blue,
yellow, green, purple, pink,

83
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,800
but not orange.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,750
But if you just
forbid orange, you've

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,050
just saved a whole
bunch of space,

86
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,506
particularly if there's a
large possible series of set.

87
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,130
You want to have the
ability to forbid.

88
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,220
Because it needs to have the
smallest model that it can

89
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,120
that covers all of its samples.

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,180
So we also have climb-tree.

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,070
Climb-tree takes one of
the elements in our model

92
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,805
and moves up the tree one level.

93
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,355
So let's say we said, only
incandescent lights are good.

94
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,480
But we found that fluorescent
lights are also good.

95
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,300
Whoop, we move up to
light source, climb-tree.

96
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,230
Extend-set-- we don't
have any sets here.

97
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,210
But let's go back to red,
blue, orange, yellow.

98
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,670
Extend-set is when we say,
only red is good as an example.

99
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,810
But we see another positive
example that's yellow.

100
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,790
So we say, OK, I'll
extend the set.

101
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,670
Red and yellow are both good.

102
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,100
All right, close-interval--
close-interval

103
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,990
is really obvious when
you need to use it.

104
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,220
Because not only is it only
used for intervals like height

105
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,020
equals 24 inches or
some kind of numbers,

106
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,420
but it is the only thing
you can use for when height

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,840
equals some kind of numbers.

108
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,270
Close-interval will let you
fuss around with the intervals

109
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,420
and say, oh, well I guess one
with a 20 inch height is OK,

110
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,020
too.

111
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,134
So we'll make the whole
interval 20 to 24 inches good.

112
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,300
Because it doesn't make any
sense for it to be like,

113
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,820
20 is good, 24 is good, but
nothing in between is good.

114
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,120
No, those are awful.

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,930
So that close-interval
covers the entire interval.

116
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,800
Last but not least is drop-link.

117
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,080
The thing about drop-link
is that drop-link is, again,

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,790
only really used due to the
fact that the system wants

119
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,560
to be as parsimonious as
possible with its model.

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
Drop-link is-- let's say you
have a color, and you're like,

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,034
OK, only red is acceptable.

122
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,200
And then you see a blue one.

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,700
It's OK.

124
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,074
And let's say red, blue, and
yellow are your only colors.

125
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,690
Only red and blue
are acceptable.

126
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,740
Hey, wait a minute.

127
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,890
No, we can just say
that only yellow

128
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,350
is not acceptable, or
something like that, all right?

129
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,090
But then you see yellow
as a positive example.

130
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,236
Actually, you can't even
switch to the yellow being

131
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,090
not acceptable,
because you've only

132
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,339
seen positive of red and blue.

133
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,505
So you say, only red
and blue are acceptable.

134
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,005
Question?

135
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,183
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that if we

136
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,766
had seen incandescent
and fluorescent,

137
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:42,840
it's OK that we could climb
the tree to light source,

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,131
because it's more parsimonious.

139
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,217
If we then see one that's
sodium vapor, say a street lamp,

140
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,712
and we reject it, do we have
to go back down the tree,

141
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:50,638
or do we just add a forbid-link?

142
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,471
PROFESSOR: Then you
would add a forbid-link.

143
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:55,240
The question is, we climb
incandescent, fluorescent,

144
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,704
to light source.

145
00:07:56,704 --> 00:07:58,370
When we see sodium
vapor, what do we do?

146
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,240
The answer is, our system,
unlike with lattice learning,

147
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,680
in arch learning, our
system is memoryless

148
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,970
of its previous examples.

149
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,400
It's incapable of going
back down the tree.

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,720
And so if you see
incandescent and fluorescent,

151
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,461
climb up to light source,
you're only recourse,

152
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,210
if you see that sodium
vapor doesn't work,

153
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,292
is to forbid-link sodium vapor.

154
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,250
That's a good question.

155
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,480
It shows good understanding
of how we work.

156
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,474
So drop-link, as you see, red
and blue, they both are OK.

157
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:26,890
You don't know about yellow,
so you can't just switch that

158
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,015
to a forbid-link to yellow.

159
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,350
But then you see
yellow is also OK.

160
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,900
What do you do?

161
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,429
You can drop the
link altogether,

162
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,120
save yourself space.

163
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,470
If all the colors that you have
in the entire world are fine,

164
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,380
you can just not have part
of your model be the color,

165
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,809
and just say, any color is fine.

166
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,500
Color must not be really
part of what defines a lamp.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,190
And I'd say it's not.

168
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,810
I mean, it's what defines
a tacky lamp, I guess.

169
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,890
But it's not what
defines a lamp.

170
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,270
So that might be why color
isn't here to begin with.

171
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,400
So to make yourself
do better on this,

172
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,320
more knowledge
equals less search.

173
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
Let's have more knowledge.

174
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,980
There's only some of these
are used to generalize,

175
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,110
to make our model more
accepting of new examples.

176
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,950
And those are ones we
would use after we've

177
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,660
seen a positive hit,
sort of generalize,

178
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,380
learn more things in the model.

179
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,460
Some of these are used
to specialize and make

180
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,850
our model refined, make
our model more specific.

181
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,440
You'd only use those
after you saw a near miss.

182
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,296
So let's actually
separate those.

183
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:30,670
That way you guys
will never make

184
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,630
the mistake of using one of
these in the wrong situation.

185
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,460
And more knowledge, less search.

186
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,510
And less search means
a faster quiz time.

187
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,490
So require-link, what
do you guys think?

188
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,864
Is that a specializer
or a generalizer?

189
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:43,780
AUDIENCE: Specializer.

190
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,370
PROFESSOR: Specializer,
that's right.

191
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,801
We'd only use it when
we saw a near miss.

192
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,704
Forbid-link, specializer
or generalizer?

193
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:50,620
AUDIENCE: Specializer.

194
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,578
PROFESSOR: Specializer.

195
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,370
We'd only forbid something
if we saw a miss.

196
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,176
Climb-tree, specializer
or generalizer?

197
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:57,050
AUDIENCE: Generalizer

198
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,140
PROFESSOR: Generalizer,
that's right.

199
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,810
We'd only climb up to a more
generic thing in the tree

200
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,340
if we saw a positive example.

201
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,364
Extend-set?

202
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:04,280
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

203
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,238
PROFESSOR: Generalizer.

204
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,920
We'd only extend the
things in our set

205
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,810
if we saw a positive example.

206
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,124
Close-interval?

207
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:11,040
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

208
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,373
PROFESSOR: That's a generalizer.

209
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:15,710
We'd only make the
interval bigger

210
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,420
if we saw a positive example.

211
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,640
Someone asks, what do you do
if you have like 10 to 30,

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,050
and then you find a
negative example in 20?

213
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,937
It's generally pretty
annoying for this system

214
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:35,020
to have to deal with that.

215
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,300
There's a variety of
things you could do

216
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,510
based on your implementation.

217
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:42,000
I've never seen us
ask it in a quiz.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,450
But one thing you could do is
forbid 20, exactly just 20,

219
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:52,350
and just have a little
hole at exactly 20.

220
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,350
So then drop-link--
specializer or generalizer?

221
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,310
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

222
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,830
PROFESSOR: Generalizer.

223
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,310
This one's an easy
one to mess up

224
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,914
if you don't
understand the system.

225
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:01,330
Because dropping, you think,
oh, getting rid of something.

226
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,163
That's specializing.

227
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,869
But actually no, you're
generalizing the entire area

228
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,160
saying, we can forget about it.

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,050
Because they're all good.

230
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,061
All right, so given that, we
are set to do this problem.

231
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,685
Hey, we have a pretty
reasonable amount

232
00:11:13,685 --> 00:11:16,880
of time considering that we
don't have to do our sums.

233
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,670
It's great.

234
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,893
So our first example
is sort of one

235
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:24,143
of those stand reading lights
that you sort of have it

236
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:27,060
on a stand, and you can
adjust the little light

237
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,510
bulb up or down.

238
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:35,190
It is an incandescent bulb.

239
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:44,440
It has a height of 11 inches.

240
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,835
And it's got a flat base.

241
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,290
It's electric.

242
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,090
It's got a shade.

243
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,820
And it's a hit.

244
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,780
It's a hit, a positive
example, a plus.

245
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,110
It's good.

246
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,740
So right away, we know
that we can only use

247
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,630
the S's or the G's?

248
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,250
The G's.

249
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,250
We can only use the G's.

250
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,041
Because it's a hit.

251
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,740
So we're not going
to be requiring.

252
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,400
We're not to be
forbidding today.

253
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,530
We're going to be happy
and using a generalizer.

254
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,230
So I'll help do the first one.

255
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,060
You guys will help
me do the next one.

256
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,300
Or someone can say,
we didn't cover this,

257
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,930
and I'll do the first
one, and we'll stop.

258
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,480
So we've got an
incandescent light.

259
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,590
That's the same as our model.

260
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,400
We've got a height of 11 inches.

261
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,660
Oh, our model only covers 24.

262
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,910
Flat base-- that's
the same as our model.

263
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,770
Electricity-- same as our model.

264
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,860
Shade-- same as our model.

265
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,860
So I say the only
difference is the height.

266
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:55,030
I say we need to close the
interval, close-interval.

267
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:02,290
And I say that our model
is the same as before,

268
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:11,965
except for that height is
an element of 11 to 24.

269
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,610
Simple enough-- I picked
the easy one for myself.

270
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,900
Next one.

271
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:42,430
So this one is going to be-- the
picture here didn't turn out.

272
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,760
But it's basically a lamp
that doesn't have a shade.

273
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
It just sort of has the
light shining on you.

274
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,290
So it is a positive example.

275
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:10,549
It's incandescent, height
equals 11.5, flat base,

276
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,215
and electricity.

277
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,315
All right, so first
of all, which kind

278
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:24,302
would we use, specializing
or generalizing?

279
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:25,260
AUDIENCE: Generalizing.

280
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,170
PROFESSOR: Generalizing,
and particularly,

281
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,020
anyone want to take a
look at our model, which

282
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:37,760
is the starting model, except
for the height can go 11 to 24?

283
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,626
Which heuristic do
we need to use here?

284
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,060
AUDIENCE: Drop-link.

285
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,390
PROFESSOR: All right, people
are all saying drop-link.

286
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,220
Yes, that's right.

287
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,230
Someone said extend-set.

288
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,940
Well, I suppose we could extend
the set to shade or not shade.

289
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,220
But that's everything.

290
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,960
So drop-link is the answer.

291
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,990
We can drop the shade.

292
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:02,190
Shade or not, this is
still pretty much a lamp.

293
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,035
So that's correct.

294
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:04,640
We drop-link.

295
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,331
So the model--
all right, there's

296
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,955
been enough changes to it that
I think I'll write it out again.

297
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:24,070
The model is
incandescent, height

298
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:36,835
equals an element from 11 to 24,
and flat base, and electricity.

299
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,335
Good, so question?

300
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:57,275
AUDIENCE: So during
this all, we're

301
00:15:57,275 --> 00:16:00,740
editing our model based on the
order that the model is in,

302
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,706
right?

303
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:04,205
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
we're editing the model based

304
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,690
on the order of the examples?

305
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,165
AUDIENCE: What
happens if there's

306
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:11,135
the same thing except with no
shade or something like that

307
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,432
afterwards?

308
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:13,890
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, what

309
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,080
happens if you have the same
thing except for that there's

310
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,070
one that's the same with no
shades and is a near miss

311
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,585
or something so
that you need to--

312
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,200
or I'm sorry, you're saying,
what if there's one that has

313
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,500
a shade now that's a near miss?

314
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,950
And so it would probably
try to forbid-link shades.

315
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,080
That's sort of the question?

316
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,920
You're right.

317
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,710
That's an inconsistency
in the data.

318
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,550
The system is very fragile.

319
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,490
It's very fragile to
ordering in particular.

320
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,690
And you'd be
surprised how awesome

321
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,370
this does considering that it
was made in, like, the '60s.

322
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,930
It's pretty impressive stuff.

323
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,670
But it's old.

324
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,761
We're not saying that this
is a way that you should do

325
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:07,010
all of your learning nowadays.

326
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,530
Because it has some
serious issues.

327
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,940
It's old, but it's pretty
damn good for what it did.

328
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,200
A newer style of this kind
of learning made by me

329
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,510
and another friend who's
now working at Google

330
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,220
is lattice learning, which
has its own share of issues,

331
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,869
one of which is that
since it's trying

332
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,060
to act like a little
kid, at first it

333
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,690
tries to claim that everything
is OK until you show it

334
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,650
some good negative examples.

335
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,330
But very particularly
one way gets around

336
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,610
this problem is
it's not memoryless.

337
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,600
It in fact stores
all of the examples

338
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,740
it's ever seen and
compares and contrasts them

339
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,150
to what it sees in
the new example.

340
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,137
And this allows it
to say something

341
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,470
like-- let's say you're trying
to teach it what can fly.

342
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,220
In lattice learning, you say,
all right, well, a blue jay

343
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,810
can fly.

344
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,890
And then if you ask it,
can a cow fly, sure,

345
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,110
a cow jumped over the moon.

346
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,140
Everything can fly.

347
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,590
So that's its problem.

348
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,780
But if you say, actually,
that was a nursery rhyme,

349
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,360
a cow cannot in fact
fly, it will then say,

350
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,980
only birds can fly.

351
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,464
Because it remembers that
the blue jay can fly.

352
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:11,005
And then you can eventually say,
well, actually bats can fly,

353
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:12,190
a fruit bat can fly.

354
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,967
Well, OK, so chiropterans
can fly and birds can fly.

355
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:17,550
But that's it.

356
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,280
And you can give it
some other examples.

357
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,070
But there are other
styles of learning.

358
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,670
You're absolutely right.

359
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,680
In fact, if there's a
multiple choice asking you

360
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,760
about the strengths and
weaknesses of arch learning,

361
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,000
one of the weaknesses-- it's
very vulnerable to ordering

362
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,530
of what you teach it.

363
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,490
But think about it.

364
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,720
If our first example
was one that's

365
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,000
exactly the same as
this but with a shade,

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,400
and it was a miss, the system
would just yell at you.

367
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,070
Like, you're kind of being an
asshole to it to give it two

368
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,530
things that are inconsistent.

369
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,340
You might say in the
real world that happens.

370
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,770
Well, arch learning, not great
with real world messy data.

371
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,980
It just goes ballistic.

372
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,750
It's very OCD.

373
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,107
It wants everything to match up.

374
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,940
If it gets two things
that are inconsistent,

375
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,402
it'll just yell at you.

376
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:06,490
It's like, you're wrong.

377
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,020
This can't be true.

378
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,390
Because you said it's
OK with the shade.

379
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,970
So that's a very good question.

380
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,083
Another question?

381
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,055
AUDIENCE: So if
you have a sample

382
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:18,506
that had two different
things for the model,

383
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,985
and it's a near miss--

384
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:21,464
PROFESSOR: It's not a near miss.

385
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,247
The question is, if
you have something

386
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:25,830
with two different things in the
model, and it's a near miss--

387
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,350
and I'm sorry to cut you off.

388
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,510
Based on timing, I'm
just going to say,

389
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,030
whatever you said
afterwards doesn't

390
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,590
apply due to the fact at that
point it's not a near miss.

391
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,820
It's very important.

392
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,780
It's only a near miss if
there's only one change.

393
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,300
Otherwise, it's just a miss.

394
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,670
And if it's a miss with
more than one change,

395
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,750
you were probably going to say,
how do you know what to change?

396
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,500
The answer is, you
can't change anything.

397
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Because any of them could
have been what was wrong.

398
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,380
That's why for a hit, oh, it
can have as many differences

399
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:51,970
as you want.

400
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,420
You'll just generalize them all.

401
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,847
For a miss, it can only
have one thing different.

402
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:58,180
In fact, there might be one
here that's not a near miss,

403
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,870
and you just say, oh,
we don't do anything.

404
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,578
We'll keep going.

405
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:02,070
We might see it if we have time.

406
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,650
So question?

407
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,725
AUDIENCE: Because ordering
is an important factor

408
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:10,343
for this bigger thing,
and you encounter an item

409
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:16,752
which has two
discrepancies in values,

410
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:20,203
but if the ordering
were different such

411
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:21,939
that that would
be accounted for,

412
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:24,147
do you remember if you turn
back to that [INAUDIBLE]?

413
00:20:24,147 --> 00:20:25,872
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, let's say

414
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:29,100
you have a non-near miss.

415
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,580
Can you hold onto
it and use it later

416
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,480
when it would be a near miss?

417
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,800
The answer is, nope.

418
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,030
If we're going here,
for a system that

419
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,580
doesn't remember things,
you can put in some kludges.

420
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,000
That definitely
makes it smarter.

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,220
It uses all its data.

422
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,520
But Patrick in the '60s making
this up strove for elegance.

423
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,800
And the elegant solution
is, let's just be memoryless

424
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,050
completely, the idea
being, well, little babies

425
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,650
can't tell you every experience
they had with playing

426
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,140
with blocks with an arch.

427
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,170
So let's remember nothing.

428
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,230
With lattice
learning, our idea is

429
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,280
that people sort of
somewhere in the subconscious

430
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,342
maybe do store all the
examples, or at least a lot

431
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,800
more than you give
them credit for.

432
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,500
So why not store them?

433
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,560
But with arch learning, it's,
little babies can't tell you,

434
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,540
oh yeah, there's that one
time I played with a lamp,

435
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,302
and it didn't have
a shade, and so

436
00:21:23,302 --> 00:21:25,010
it wasn't a lamp, or
something like that.

437
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,718
They're not going to
be able to store it.

438
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,892
They're not going to be
able to save it for later.

439
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:31,350
Sort of in the
style of Turing, who

440
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,970
believed a human would be
a teacher to a computer,

441
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,780
arch learning really
focuses on the fact

442
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,320
that the human is a kind
and good teacher who

443
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,740
offers examples that are
exactly appropriate at the time.

444
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,500
And that puts a lot
of pressure on you

445
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,330
as the trainer of an
arch learning system.

446
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,230
Good questions, all.

447
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,720
Let's continue
working this guy out.

448
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,910
So the next example is
basically another one

449
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,420
of these stand lamps.

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,340
It's got a light shining
down, which is fluorescent.

451
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,165
It looks like this.

452
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,760
It's fluorescent.

453
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:22,250
Height equals 13 inches,
flat base, electric, shade.

454
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,970
And yeah, as I put
here, it's a hit.

455
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,250
So as you guys have
told me countless times,

456
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,820
so I believe you
that you remember,

457
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,840
we're going to
generalize for the hit.

458
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,630
So what should we do here?

459
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,620
So some people are
saying extend-set.

460
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,560
AUDIENCE: Climb-tree.

461
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,770
PROFESSOR: The people who are
saying climb-tree are correct.

462
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,010
Why do we climb-tree
instead of extend-set?

463
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,620
Because of the fact that
it's a tree, not a set.

464
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,060
And it is more
parsimonious to climb

465
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,750
the tree than it is to treat
it as a set and extend the set.

466
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,210
Sets don't have a hierarchy.

467
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:16,560
It's just like red comma blue
comma yellow, or shade comma

468
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,950
not shade.

469
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,830
Whenever you have
a tree, it's a fact

470
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,670
that it's more parsimonious
to just climb it

471
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,170
than it is to treat it
as a set and extend it,

472
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,290
even though you could
do that, I suppose.

473
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,320
And arch learning,
it's parsimonious.

474
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,050
It's elegant.

475
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,000
It's simple.

476
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,710
And the elegant thing
to do-- just climb up.

477
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,260
So yes, we're going
to climb up the tree.

478
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:51,810
So our model is the same as last
time except that this time it

479
00:23:51,810 --> 00:24:02,200
has a light source instead
of saying, incandescent.

480
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,720
It just climbed up to
light source, sure.

481
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,880
All right, so the next
one is pretty cool.

482
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,130
It's another one of those
fluorescent shine down lamps.

483
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,060
But in space, it has a
tripod with three legs.

484
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,890
And those legs all have wheels.

485
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,050
So it is also a hit.

486
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:39,000
So it is fluorescent, height
equals 14 inches, wheeled legs,

487
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,950
and electric.

488
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,900
So obviously we're generalizing.

489
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,867
What heuristic will
we use this time?

490
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:49,120
AUDIENCE: Climb-tree.

491
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,370
PROFESSOR: Climb-tree
again, that's right.

492
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:58,640
We're going to climb from flat
base to base support itself.

493
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,266
Because wheeled
legs and flat base,

494
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,200
base support is an
ancestor of both.

495
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,677
So our model is
the same as before.

496
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,260
But at this point,
it's changed enough

497
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,290
that I might as
well write it out.

498
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:30,510
So we'll say that it is light
source, height between 11

499
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:38,644
and 24 inches, base support,
some sort of support,

500
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:39,310
and electricity.

501
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
Awesome, now, come on parity.

502
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,890
Ah, no, back up, you.

503
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,000
There we go.

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,120
So that down there,
don't get confused.

505
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
That down there is
our most recent model.

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:16,520
We now have-- oh, oops, hehe.

507
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,200
OK, I actually missed
one of the examples.

508
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,250
However, we were actually
completely correct,

509
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,850
which gives away quite a lot.

510
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:36,070
We had a miss, incandescent
bulb-- back in the old days

511
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,740
when incandescent was the
only kind of light we had.

512
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:51,250
Height equals 60 inches,
flat, back in the old days

513
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,890
when flat was the only
one we had, electric,

514
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,470
back in the old days
when we had electric.

515
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,470
And we also have
shade after we've

516
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,660
dropped the link for shade.

517
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,160
So we know that shade or
not shade are both OK.

518
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:17,190
So the question
is, what do we do?

519
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,335
First of all, do we specialize
or generalize with this miss?

520
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:21,210
AUDIENCE: Specialize.

521
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,230
PROFESSOR: So obviously we're
only to be able to require

522
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,900
or forbid.

523
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,890
So standardly, traditionally,
the answer would be nothing.

524
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,405
However, we accept it
as sane the possibility

525
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:41,780
that you might put a
require onto the height.

526
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,730
Some students did
that, like say, oh

527
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,810
gosh, that's a
hard set, 11 to 24.

528
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,180
But that's not what
you would normally do.

529
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,300
So just to show that we tried
to understand that there might

530
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,640
be multiple ideas in
a weird situation,

531
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,750
we did accept that
that one time.

532
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,080
But generally, there's not
anything you have to do.

533
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,690
This system at the time, and
still now, said 11 to 24.

534
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,750
This is spookily exactly
the correct place

535
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,700
where this example would go.

536
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,190
But you don't have to do
anything to the model.

537
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,220
You don't have to
use any heuristics.

538
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,301
OK, so last step, -- the
question is-- oh, question.

539
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:28,768
AUDIENCE: So here, if we did
it in this particular order,

540
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:31,253
having it be the
next [INAUDIBLE]

541
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:34,235
in our example
list, then it only

542
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:37,714
differs by one from our
existing model, right?

543
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:39,482
PROFESSOR: No, it
differs by a lot.

544
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:41,690
It actually wouldn't be a
near miss if we did it out.

545
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,815
AUDIENCE: It would be a
near miss if we did it out.

546
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:47,720
PROFESSOR: No, incandescent is
different than light source.

547
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,510
Height is different than height.

548
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,500
Flat is different
than base support.

549
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,422
So it would differ
by a huge number,

550
00:28:58,422 --> 00:28:59,844
and it would not be a near miss.

551
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:01,896
AUDIENCE: OK, then
here's a question.

552
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:06,693
Even though on the
tree incandescent

553
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:14,045
is a child branching
off of light source,

554
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:18,130
if we instead encountered--
because our current model says

555
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,272
light source comma
whatnot, if instead we

556
00:29:21,272 --> 00:29:26,180
got a negative thing that
said, fluorescent, again,

557
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,720
would that be considered
not a near miss,

558
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,116
because fluorescent
differs from light source?

559
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,770
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, would it

560
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,505
not be considered a near miss
if you had, say, fluorescent

561
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:42,380
rather than light source,
because fluorescent

562
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,460
differs from light source?

563
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,798
So the answer there is--

564
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,401
AUDIENCE: Since
it's memoryless, it

565
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:52,380
doesn't know that fluorescent--

566
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,180
PROFESSOR: Well sure,
it is memoryless.

567
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,971
It doesn't know that
fluorescent used to be

568
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:57,300
a positive example before.

569
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,620
Unfortunately, let's say
we did have an example that

570
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,600
was fluorescent, height
is an element of 11 to 24,

571
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,220
base support, electric.

572
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,760
Actually, let's say we have
one that was sodium vapor,

573
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,050
height is 13.

574
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,820
Sodium vapor, height
is 13, base support--

575
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,032
for some reason it was called
base support and electric.

576
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:18,990
That's possible, right?

577
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,930
We haven't seen a
positive of sodium vapor.

578
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,570
Let's say that sodium
vapor was not allowed.

579
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,570
If we don't say that that's a
near miss and then forbid-link

580
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,130
sodium vapor, how
are we ever going

581
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,090
to get rid of sodium vapor?

582
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,000
Unfortunately,
because of that, we

583
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,770
lose some amount
of expressiveness.

584
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,572
Actually, what you're saying is
very logical and makes sense,

585
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:43,530
that you would want to
have the ability to say,

586
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,560
OK, this is a subset.

587
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,567
This should be OK.

588
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,150
But unfortunately,
because of the fact

589
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,566
that we climbed
the tree even when

590
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,990
we haven't seen a positive
example for all things

591
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,670
in the bottom on that tree,
we actually lose that ability.

592
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,180
It's a trade-off.

593
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,870
It is most certainly a
weakness of arch learning

594
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,070
that you point out here.

595
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,080
Lattice learning fixes that,
but it has its own problems.

596
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,190
So you're right, that you'd
want to be able to do that.

597
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,920
But you can't.

598
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
Because it's memoryless.

599
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
So last but not
least, which model

600
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,850
would we present in order
to teach the system, right

601
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:22,280
now from its final system, that
a lamp requires a base support?

602
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,590
So it would need to be
require-link for the base

603
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,310
support.

604
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,710
So really fast--
incandescent bulb

605
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,340
with a height of 6, a flat
base, and electricity.

606
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,320
Would that do it?

607
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,820
Incandescent bulb
with a height of 8

608
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,792
and a battery, incandescent
bulb with a height of 12, wire

609
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:41,750
support, and electricity--
oh yeah, by the way,

610
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,700
this will have to be a
miss to teach a require.

611
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,510
Fluorescent bulb, height of 21,
clamp base, and electricity,

612
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,170
or incandescent
bulb, height of 12,

613
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,620
flat bottomed legs,
and electricity--

614
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,300
so did anyone pick that out over
the fastness of me saying it?

615
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
Because [INAUDIBLE] is
going to want to come in.

616
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,279
Question or answer?

617
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,195
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

618
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,787
PROFESSOR: It's
going to have a miss.

619
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,370
AUDIENCE: If it's
on the wire support?

620
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,330
PROFESSOR: Yes.

621
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,480
So I know it was fast.

622
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,224
You can look through
quiz 2007 final.

623
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:12,390
Because [INAUDIBLE] is going
to come in in a minute.

624
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,973
But it would be a
miss on the one that

625
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,275
was correct on everything except
for it was a wire support.

626
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,150
Then the question you
have is, wait a minute,

627
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,440
it says incandescent bulb.

628
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,360
That is now a subset
of light source.

629
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,930
You have his question again.

630
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:29,760
The answer to that is they
must have decided here

631
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,172
that that was OK.

632
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:32,630
But on the other
hand, how would it

633
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,970
learn sodium vapor if that
wasn't decided to be OK?

634
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,570
That's going to have to be
an implementation detail.

635
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,590
So one thing you can do
is try to treat subsets

636
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,330
as OK in the logical way.

637
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,200
Because questions may do that.

638
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,960
And then I guess
you've lost the ability

639
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,730
to forbid, say, sodium vapor.

640
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,110
So you have to lose
one or the other.

641
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,320
I think you're definitely OK
to ask TAs or someone who's

642
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,960
proctoring if a
situation like that

643
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,570
comes up, which implementation
detail is chosen.

644
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,820
Because you could choose
either when you're running

645
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,530
arch learning.

<p><span m="9400">PROF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="9450">PATRICK WINSTON: It's too bad, in a way, that we can't paint</span> <span m="11430">everything black, because this map coloring problem sure</span> <span m="14260">would be a lot easier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="17410">So I don't know what we're going to do about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="21930">How long is this going to take?</span> </p>
<p><span m="23920">Here's what we're going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24740">We're going to wait till either all the laptops are</span> <span m="26480">closed, or this program terminates,</span> <span m="28910">whichever comes first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="32520">So how long is this going to take?</span> </p>
<p><span m="34690">I actually don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="36590">I think it'll take more than the life time of the universe,</span> <span m="38690">but I'm not sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="39700">So let's take a look at a slightly easier</span> <span m="42730">map coloring problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="44560">We'll stop this one and change the map to something I call</span> <span m="47290">[? simplicia. ?]</span> <span m="49340">There's 26 states, one for each letter in the alphabet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="53780">And what we're going to do is we're going to do a depth</span> <span m="55930">first search for a suitable coloring of this map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="61350">We're going to go in order, A, B, C, D, E. And as I've</span> <span m="64340">suggested here, at each level we're going to rotate the</span> <span m="68140">color choices so we don't over use any one color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="71890">So if we launch this particular search, this depth</span> <span m="74800">first attempt to color this map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="77830">There it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="78530">And maybe we should wait until it terminates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="81420">Or maybe we should just let it run and it'll terminate,</span> <span m="85200">perhaps, sometime within the lecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="87360">Or maybe we should just let it run over the weekend.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90960">Or how long do you think we would have to wait, if we want</span> <span m="93979">to come back and watch it terminate?</span> </p>
<p><span m="97206">At roughly 30 frames a second--</span> <span m="99250">I'm calculating it all in my head, I don't want to bet my</span> <span m="101960">life on it-- but I think about 5,000 years.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106530">And if we want to use as many states as there are in the</span> <span m="110330">United States, in this demonstration, you get up to</span> <span m="113990">numbers like 10 to the 17th years--</span> <span m="118940">17th, 18th, 16th, I'm not exactly sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="121270">I did a rough calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="123670">And, of course, you could do some parallels into that, and</span> <span m="126100">it's not as bad as chess, where you need all the atoms</span> <span m="128020">in the universe and you still can't do it,</span> <span m="129358">and things like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="130570">Acting as computers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="131510">But still, it's pretty horrendous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="134420">The problem is, well the problem is illustrated by this</span> <span m="140570">diagram I put in back of me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="142810">If you do a depth first search and you have a</span> <span m="147950">problem like Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="151590">Texas has always, always been a problem, ever since they</span> <span m="157940">joined the Union.</span> </p>
<p><span m="159140">I could pick on other states, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="161329">Kentucky, Tennessee, if you're from those states you</span> <span m="165310">represent something even worse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="167630">But Texas is down there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="168700">And the trouble is, if you assign a color to Arizona,</span> <span m="173980">Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana first, and then wait</span> <span m="178730">around to Texas last, then you get yourself into a bind by</span> <span m="185560">your fourth choice, that you don't discover until you're</span> <span m="188620">48th choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="190780">So what happens then, is that you start developing this tree</span> <span m="193840">like this, you get to those states surrounding Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="198710">Texas is last state assigned a color and there's</span> <span m="201940">nothing left for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="203510">And that problem was there on the fourth choice, and you</span> <span m="206316">don't discover it until your 50th choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="208700">So you develop a horrendous, impossible, impossible search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="213040">So you simply can't do it that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="217070">But now, not to worry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="220270">I've come equipped with the idea of constraint</span> <span m="222400">propagation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="224410">So we could just take a country with four</span> <span m="226170">states, like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227840">Each can be labeled red, green, blue and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="232180">So just like in a case of line drawings, we'll pile up all</span> <span m="235079">the possible things that the value can be-- red, green,</span> <span m="239270">blue and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="240740">Red, green, blue and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="243420">Red, green, blue and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="246460">And we start up constraint propagation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="249330">So we say for the upper left hand corner state, is there</span> <span m="253200">any reason to believe that R is impossible?</span> </p>
<p><span m="256329">Well we look at our neighbors and see what kind of</span> <span m="258190">constraint flows in from them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="260329">And sure, this guy could be green, and this</span> <span m="262070">guy could be blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="263320">They don't have to be red, so there's nothing</span> <span m="267060">that rules out red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="269770">And there's nothing the rules out blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="271310">And there's nothing that rules out yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="274250">And there's nothing that rules out green.</span> </p>
<p><span m="276430">So constraint propagation just sits there with its finger up</span> <span m="280422">its nose, doing nothing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="283380">So it doesn't look like we can use either depth first search,</span> <span m="289630">or constraint propagation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="292470">So we could just give up and cry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="295659">But maybe there's some other approach that will help.</span> </p>
<p><span m="299500">So let me actually work the Texas problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="302810">So with apologies to Houston and Tyler,</span> <span m="308690">here's a map of Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="315696">There we are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="316595">And here's, roughly speaking, Arizona</span> <span m="319660">is over here somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="321530">And we've got Oklahoma in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323220">And old Bill Clinton's state, Arkansas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="327440">And then Louisiana sticks out there a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="330420">So there's our map of that</span> <span m="333700">particular part of the country.</span> </p>
<p><span m="336170">So we've got Arizona here, Oklahoma here, Arkansas here,</span> <span m="343310">and Louisiana here, and Texas here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="347350">And we have elected to assign colors to these states, in</span> <span m="352060">that order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="352900">So this is one, two, three, four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="359970">And we're going to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="362530">We're going to rotate our color choices, just so we</span> <span m="364720">don't over use any one color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="368460">But we're going to also have a look at Texas as we go around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371620">Because Texas is a state that borders on the States they</span> <span m="374930">were choosing colors for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="378740">So the only possible colors that Texas could be are red,</span> <span m="383050">green, blue, and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="388510">So as we make our choices around here, we'll say that--</span> <span m="393510">we don't have to adhere to any particular style-- we can say</span> <span m="396540">that Arizona is going to get the colored red, R. That's</span> <span m="403800">going to rule out R over here for Texas, because no adjacent</span> <span m="407240">states can have the same color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="410750">Then we go over to Oklahoma, and we're rotating our color</span> <span m="413020">choices, so we'll say that can be green.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416670">And that's fine, because it's consistent with the red here,</span> <span m="419610">but it rules out the possibility that</span> <span m="421190">Texas could be green.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423820">And then we go over here to Arkansas, red, green, blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="430170">That's fine, that's consistent with the green on Oklahoma,</span> <span m="433460">but if we look at its neighbors we know that Texas</span> <span m="436270">is forever forbidden to be blue, now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="440580">So now we go over to Louisiana, and remember, we're</span> <span m="443110">rotating our color choices because we don't want to</span> <span m="445280">overuse them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="447240">So this means that the first choice we're going to make</span> <span m="449046">here, for Louisiana, is yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="453400">And that's fine because it's consistent with Arkansas, but</span> <span m="456380">it's not so fine because it's now ruled out the last</span> <span m="460110">possibility for Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="463220">So even though Texas is going to be the 48th state that we</span> <span m="468040">color, we're going to say, at this point, there's no</span> <span m="471770">need in going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="472830">We'd better back up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="474680">Because there's nothing left for Texas when we get around</span> <span m="476920">to coloring it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="478530">So that means that this yellow is ruled out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="482990">This yellow reappears.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485550">We select the next color in my line for Louisiana, which</span> <span m="489740">happens to be red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="491640">And now that's consistent with this yellow that's</span> <span m="495310">still left for Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="496800">And it's also consistent with the blue</span> <span m="498260">that's up here for Arkansas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="501270">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="502210">I wonder if maybe we could make an algorithm out of that,</span> <span m="505580">and solve problems like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="506980">Do you see, sort of, the intuition of what we're doing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="509860">We're actually using the martial arts principle, again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="511970">Because the whole problem is that local constraints,</span> <span m="515520">undiscovered local constraints, are causing</span> <span m="517600">downstream problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="519720">So we're going to use the enemy's powers against him,</span> <span m="522799">and we're going to look at those local constraints as we</span> <span m="524750">go and make sure they're not going downstream, not going to</span> <span m="527910">get us later on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="529980">So now I'm going to look like I'm getting a little formal,</span> <span m="535060">but I'm just getting a little bit more formal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="536890">Because I want to have some language that I can use to</span> <span m="542090">describe what's going on, so that it's clear what the</span> <span m="544100">choices are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546180">So to start off with, we're going to have to have some</span> <span m="548590">vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="550310">So let's start up our vocabulary here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="553670">We're going to have a notion of a variable v. And that's</span> <span m="562000">something that can have an assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="581850">There's nothing complicated about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="583290">And a value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="588700">A value x is something that can be in assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="597360">It's a little bit circular, but we're all in computer</span> <span m="598880">science so you know what I mean.</span> </p>
<p><span m="601300">So the next thing is a little slightly less obvious, and</span> <span m="605770">that's the notion of a domain, d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611870">And that's going to be a bag of values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="619190">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="619520">So one more thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="621150">A constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="627810">That's a constraint c, is a limit on--</span> <span m="636080">in our examples it's mostly going to be pairs of</span> <span m="638670">variables, pairs of variable values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="640910">But in general, it could be variable values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="651570">So if we go back here to Texas we could say, OK, how does our</span> <span m="655040">vocabulary drape itself over that configuration?</span> </p>
<p><span m="658190">And the answer is, the states have the role of variables,</span> <span m="663420">the colors have the role of values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="668670">And the domains are the remaining color possibilities</span> <span m="671780">that we can still use on a particular state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="674510">And the constraint, in this case, is the simple map</span> <span m="676770">coloring constraint that no states that share a boundary</span> <span m="680770">can have the same color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="683100">So states are variables, colors are values, domains are</span> <span m="686840">bags of colors, and constraints--</span> <span m="689760">there's only one--</span> <span m="691310">adjacent states can't have the same color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="694330">So that's how it fits with this vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="697440">So now, what did I actually do here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="699800">Well what I actually did here, I'm going to now formalize a</span> <span m="702950">little by writing it down in pseudo code.</span> </p>
<p><span m="707500">So here we are, we're going to have a look at what we did</span> <span m="711100">here with our intuition, and we're going to</span> <span m="713630">reduce it to a procedure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="715700">And here's the procedure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="720720">Remember, we're doing depth first search on this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="722860">I did a depth first search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="724650">We're going to do a depth first search, and for each</span> <span m="730200">depth first search assignment--</span> <span m="739190">OK, so here I am, I'm labeling Arizona, and then Oklahoma,</span> <span m="743610">and then Arkansas, and then Louisiana.</span> </p>
<p><span m="746250">When I give each one of those a label, a color, I'm going to</span> <span m="750500">do this procedure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="752210">Every time I make one of those assignments.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753495">The last one that caused trouble was</span> <span m="756640">coloring Louisiana yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758230">Each time I put one of those colors down, each time I make</span> <span m="761520">an assignment, I'm going to do this procedure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="763070">So for each depth first search assignment, for each variable</span> <span m="776690">v, considered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="783730">Now you don't know what I mean by considered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="786390">But when I put a label, when I put up a value, show something</span> <span m="792300">as a color for Louisiana, I thought about Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797340">So I was considering the variable, Texas, when I made</span> <span m="800340">the assignment for Louisiana.</span> </p>
<p><span m="802662">Now I'm going to be a little bit vague about what I mean by</span> <span m="804890">considered, right now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="805720">Because there are lots of choices about how much stuff</span> <span m="807500">you actually consider.</span> </p>
<p><span m="809240">So let me just say consider, and then we'll open that up</span> <span m="811390">and talk about the options in a moment, so for each variable</span> <span m="815930">v considered for--</span> <span m="820560">let's call that variable v sub i--</span> <span m="824040">for each x sub i, for each value in the domain of that</span> <span m="833340">variable, consider each of the things that still surviving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="838760">For each of those, for each constraint c, that's between x</span> <span m="853530">sub i, and some x sub j, where x sub j is an element of the</span> <span m="866390">domain of j.</span> </p>
<p><span m="869050">Now that sounds awfully fancy, but this just says, in the</span> <span m="872020">case of Texas up there, whenever I consider one of the</span> <span m="875940">values that's still remaining as a choice for Texas, I want</span> <span m="880170">to consider all of the constraints between that</span> <span m="882700">variable and the adjacent states.</span> </p>
<p><span m="887550">And I want to be sure that anything I leave in the domain</span> <span m="892600">is OK for some selection in the other states, some</span> <span m="896350">remaining choices in the other states.</span> </p>
<p><span m="898960">So that's why we're getting pretty nested here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901090">But we're doing depth first search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="904540">We are considering the variables in a certain</span> <span m="907740">collection of variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="912660">For each one of those where considering all the values</span> <span m="915160">that still remain in the domains of those variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="918350">And then for each of those values, we're checking to see</span> <span m="920950">if it satisfies this some constraint, satisfies the</span> <span m="924010">constraint that are placed upon it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927280">So for each of these constraints if there does not</span> <span m="932580">exist an x sub j, such that, the constraint between x sub i</span> <span m="940910">and x sub j is satisfied, well if in that adjacent place</span> <span m="951090">there's nothing that is consistent with a value, then</span> <span m="954770">we've got to get rid of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957380">If that's true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="958350">If there does not exist some value in an adjacent variable</span> <span m="963810">such that that constraint is satisfied, we're hosed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="966380">We've got to get rid of that value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="968770">So we're going to remove x sub i from d sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="982970">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="983250">Now, that's fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="985070">That's sort of what I did with Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="987730">As soon as I plopped down a value for Louisiana I said,</span> <span m="991610">well what are the possible values in Texas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="993770">Red, green, blue and yellow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="995610">Let's consider red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="997620">Let's consider the constraints between Texas and</span> <span m="999480">all adjacent states.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001160">One of those constraints says it can't be the</span> <span m="1002660">same color as Arizona.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1004660">The only color I've got available for Arizona, since</span> <span m="1006690">I've already made the assignment is red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1008870">Red is not consistent with red, so I've got</span> <span m="1010580">to get rid of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1013070">So it looks complicated, but it's just intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1017080">So what do we do if we get to a situation where</span> <span m="1019780">the domain is empty?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1021710">That means whenever we get around to making assignment to</span> <span m="1023975">it, there won't be anything left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1026560">So if that ever happens, if the domain ever becomes empty,</span> <span m="1041310">then what do we do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042746">We've got to back up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1051010">So the intuition is clear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1052130">This is the algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1053070">The algorithm when you work through it, think about</span> <span m="1055960">whether it makes sense and what not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1057360">How it fits with Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058370">Yeah, it sure does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1059190">All we're doing is we're making these death first</span> <span m="1062160">assignments.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1062710">And in the neighborhood of those depth first assignments</span> <span m="1065290">we're looking around to see if the values that are possible</span> <span m="1068980">include something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1069960">And if they don't include anything, we know we made and</span> <span m="1073180">irrevocable blunder, and we have to back up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077380">So that's the essence of the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1081050">Now, how well does it work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1084050">Well a little bit depends on what we choose for considered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1091570">There are lots of choices for what we consider.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1096520">So let me enumerate some of those choices and then we'll</span> <span m="1100360">have a look and see what they do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1115950">Oh I guess one possibility is to consider nothing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1130070">Let's try it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136920">So our type of search is going to be no checks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140470">What do you think is going to happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1144590">We're not even checking the assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1147910">That's pretty fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1149380">Unfortunately, since we haven't even check the most</span> <span m="1151560">recent assignment, we get lots of places where there are</span> <span m="1154490">states that are adjacent to each other that</span> <span m="1156490">have the same color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1158130">That's no good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162940">So another thing we can do is consider everything</span> <span m="1167440">everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176060">That's no good, because that would say, as soon as we color</span> <span m="1178600">our first state, we check to make sure that all 47 other</span> <span m="1183020">states can be colored.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1185270">That seems like it over doing it a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189090">But in any case, at least we want to check the assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1201200">So if we go back here and check the assignment, let's</span> <span m="1205230">see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1211995">Type assignments, assignments only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1214950">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1215650">Aw, gees, that's where I got in trouble before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1218580">This is the thing is going to run for 17 billion years at</span> <span m="1226140">nanosecond or something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1228330">It's only a billion years if you run it at nanosecond</span> <span m="1230630">speed, so I guess maybe you could do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233760">Have a fast computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1235110">But this isn't going to work because of our unfortunate</span> <span m="1237360">choice of Texas as the last state to be considered, and</span> <span m="1242950">the unfortunate coloring of the four surrounding states</span> <span m="1245690">right up front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1247280">And our unfortunate decision to rotate the color so as to</span> <span m="1250100">avoid overdoing any one color.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1254310">So this doesn't work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1255200">We know we went to the trouble of working out the business</span> <span m="1258760">with Texas by hand, using the domain reduction algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1263950">Better make a note that this is the</span> <span m="1265470">domain reduction algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276340">And what we're going to do is we're going to check the</span> <span m="1278250">neighbors of the assignments.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1281120">Just like we did here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1281970">We checked Texas each time we made one of those four</span> <span m="1284360">choices, because it's a neighbor of all of the choices</span> <span m="1288050">of the states that we made.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1290490">So one thing to do is to check neighbors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1297900">This is one, two, three, now let's see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1310250">Check neighbors only, go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1331450">Shoot, I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1332390">It's OK with Texas, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1335560">Because it didn't color the states around Texas with all</span> <span m="1340522">of the four color choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1342760">But it's still getting into trouble in other places.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1348490">Like the states like Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee,</span> <span m="1352930">states with lots of boundaries.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1357670">So I don't know whether this is going to--</span> <span m="1360080">oh, there it finally worked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1363350">It went through a lot of effort, though.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1366010">For the sake of comparison, we might make a note that it ran</span> <span m="1368540">into 9,139 dead ends.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1381250">But it did do some good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382720">It didn't take a length of time longer than the remaining</span> <span m="1387200">part of the universe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389620">But if it's a good idea to check the neighbors, if we</span> <span m="1393140">make a change to the neighbors, what might that</span> <span m="1396580">suggests that we do in addition?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1400940">Well it might suggest that if we make a change to a</span> <span m="1402680">neighbor, that we check its neighbors, too, make sure</span> <span m="1406790">they're all right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1409040">So another choice is to propagate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443460">So propagate through variables with reduced domains.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448370">Let's see how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1461510">Wait a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1464570">I must have made a mistake.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466210">Let's try that again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1468470">Oh, maybe we better slow it down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475760">All that grey stuff is showing the limit of the propagation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1485270">Man it's, let's see at four second of 40,</span> <span m="1489790">that's about 10 seconds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495520">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1497190">Not bad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1498340">Zero dead ends.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1500130">And it was a lot faster.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1501080">I didn't happen to notice how many constraints were checked</span> <span m="1502854">on that other thing, I think it was around 20,000 or so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1506130">This is a lot less.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1508700">So this looks like a good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511320">But why did I label it number five?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514255">Well because there's something between this and number three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1517960">So number four is, through v with d reduced to one value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1536000">So we're not going to propagate through all of the</span> <span m="1538730">variables which have their domains shrunk a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1542750">We're only going to propagate through those that have the</span> <span m="1544610">greater shrinkage, all the way down to a single value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549520">So let's see how that might work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1562590">Anybody want to place any bets on this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1565860">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1566280">We checked 2,623 constraints last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570490">Let's see what happens this time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1574580">You can see that the extent of the gray is less, because it's</span> <span m="1577930">not propagating so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1588630">And as we breathily await the answer, I'd say we've found</span> <span m="1600690">our winner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1601505">As this does a couple of dead ends, but the number of</span> <span m="1605000">constraint checked is less than 1,000.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1609020">So in general, with problems this, you have all of these</span> <span m="1611360">choices for what you consider.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1613690">You don't want to consider nothing, because then you're</span> <span m="1615320">not honoring your constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1617450">You'll certainly want to consider the things you just</span> <span m="1619320">made assignments for, because otherwise you'll construct a</span> <span m="1625670">solution that violates a constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1628910">You don't want to do everything, because that's</span> <span m="1632190">excessive work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1634050">And so checking the neighbors is a good idea, but it's</span> <span m="1640830">always better in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643305">In practice, inevitably it's the case that it's better to</span> <span m="1646160">do some propagation through the</span> <span m="1647440">things that you've changed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1649000">How much propagation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1650520">It doesn't seem to do much good to propagate through</span> <span m="1652540">things are just changed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1654070">But it does seem to do some good to propagate through the</span> <span m="1656630">things that have changed and been</span> <span m="1657730">reduced to a single value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1660590">So as soon as you get a neighbor of some assignment</span> <span m="1663400">you just made that has its domain reduced to a single</span> <span m="1666290">value, then you check its neighbors, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1668730">So you check the neighbors, of the neighbors, of the</span> <span m="1670410">neighbors, of the neighbors, on and on and on, as long as</span> <span m="1674290">you've found a domain being reduced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1677950">And not only being reduced, but reduced to a signal value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681180">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681580">So that's the demand reduction algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1683230">And I guarantee you a problem like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1686860">And I know you don't know how to work those problems yet,</span> <span m="1690300">because this is a little bit abstract.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1692060">And to work these problems in the exam setting you need to</span> <span m="1696340">know a little bit about how to keep track of the variable</span> <span m="1699250">values that remain in the domain, and</span> <span m="1701690">that sort of thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702310">And you'll learn more about that in your recitations, and</span> <span m="1704810">in this mega recitation, and in the tutorials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1708780">So we could go home except that there are few little</span> <span m="1711240">flourishes to deal with here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1713840">And those flourishes, include some dirty,</span> <span m="1723210">filthy little secrets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725520">For example, I've chosen, as my classroom</span> <span m="1728830">example, to pick on Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1731390">And arranged for this situation to</span> <span m="1733620">be especially ugly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1736130">So I could arrange the states in a different way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1741080">We have highly constrained states, that have a lot of</span> <span m="1743420">bordering states around them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1746250">And we have other states, like Maine, up there, that only</span> <span m="1751950">borders on one other state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1754660">So I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1757550">Will, what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762980">Should we arrange the states for our death first search in</span> <span m="1766840">the order of least constrained to most constrained, or most</span> <span m="1770490">constrained to least constrained?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1775690">In other words, should we start with Missouri, or</span> <span m="1779080">Tennessee, or Kentucky, or something like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1781730">Or should we start with Maine?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1784254">What do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1786206">You have a 50% chance of getting it right, just by</span> <span m="1789140">[? looking ?] at points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1791650">WILL: Start with the most first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1793950">PROF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1793978">PATRICK WINSTON: He thinks we should start with the most</span> <span m="1794920">constraint first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1796600">Do we have a volunteer who wants to suggest that we start</span> <span m="1799490">with the least constraint first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1802210">That's the way I always work on stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1805570">I'm working on a book or something, I have 500 things</span> <span m="1809050">to fix, I'll always choose to work on the easiest stuff</span> <span m="1811920">first, so that I feel like I'm making the list a lot smaller.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815980">Leave the hardest things to last.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818400">But we don't have any volunteers who want to bet on</span> <span m="1821910">that idea of least constraint first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1825060">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1826700">Jason wants to suggest that we should work on least</span> <span m="1829010">constraint first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1830050">Well we have ground truth, because we</span> <span m="1831370">can just try it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837300">I guess we'll stick with our shrinking to one</span> <span m="1839030">value thing, here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1841950">But we will reorder things so that we have the least</span> <span m="1846880">constrained first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851940">So right away, we got a color for Maine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1858160">Maybe we ought to speed this up a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864540">Well, that's a good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1866450">Jason suggested this and we only 1,732 constraints and we</span> <span m="1872020">had 59 dead ends.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1873010">So let's try the other way around, and we'll go back to</span> <span m="1878910">four frames a second.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1892890">So we're working, kind of from the middle of the country out,</span> <span m="1894940">with this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1896330">We're going to deal with Maine, I guess, last.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1903870">Which is better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1906520">Too bad, I think it looks like this is better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1909640">In fact, let's not be so aggressive with the use of</span> <span m="1912840">constraint propagation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1913950">Let's just check the assignments only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1916710">If we go back to an arrangement where we have</span> <span m="1919060">least constrained first, and we'll crank up the speed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1926140">Well actually, we would have to crank it up pretty big,</span> <span m="1928190">because the states like Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky,</span> <span m="1932700">they're going to be like Texas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936264">And so were kind of back to the length of the universe</span> <span m="1938730">type problem, here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1939420">With the least constraint first, and no use of</span> <span m="1942640">constraints, other than to check the current assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1948090">So let's stop that, though, and check the most constrained</span> <span m="1952440">first, assignments only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1955790">I don't know how long's this going to take.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1959880">That's the dirty little secret.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1962150">If we had arranged our states from most constrained to least</span> <span m="1966010">constrained, ordinary depth first search with none of this</span> <span m="1968440">stuff we talked about today would work just fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1971840">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1976700">So it's a little bit like games.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1980460">Do you use progressive deepening, or do</span> <span m="1982260">you use alpha beta?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1983500">And the answer is both.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1984885">You use everything you've got to deal with the problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1989730">And depending on the problem, one or another of the things</span> <span m="1994410">you incorporate into your approach will work just great,</span> <span m="1997250">if you're lucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000040">So now, I promise that this is useful not only for people who</span> <span m="2004035">want to color maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2004755">God, who wants to do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005820">We know it can be done with four colors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2008000">But it's also useful for doing all kinds of</span> <span m="2010870">resource planning problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2013530">So I want to show you a resource planning problem, and</span> <span m="2015900">I want you think about-- while I'm doing it--</span> <span m="2017810">think about whether it's actually analogous to the map</span> <span m="2019900">coloring problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2020700">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022280">So here's the deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2023180">You have just landed a summer job with the Jet</span> <span m="2026950">Green, a new airline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2030210">And Jet Green is a low cost, no frills, hardly any</span> <span m="2038560">maintenance type of airline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2041460">And they want to fly mostly between Boston and New York.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2045730">Occasionally they want to fly to Los Angeles.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048480">And they're trying to get by with the</span> <span m="2049880">smallest number of airplanes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2051889">So that's why we have a kind of resource allocation problem</span> <span m="2055351">with Jet Green.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057500">So I'm going to write down what their</span> <span m="2059889">schedule looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060350">They have one flight, F1, that goes from Boston</span> <span m="2066590">to JFK, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072429">It's an early in the day flight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075739">Then they want to have another one, F2, that</span> <span m="2079000">flies from JFK to Boston.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2087389">And then they want to have another flight a little later</span> <span m="2090489">in the day that flies from Boston to JFK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2097420">And a little later than that, they want to have another</span> <span m="2099340">flight that goes from JFK to Boston.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2104580">They're going to start off mostly as a shuttle airline in</span> <span m="2107230">the beginning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107670">So that's F1, F2, F3, and F4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113430">And they have a fifth flight, F5, that goes from Boston to</span> <span m="2118460">Los Angeles, that takes a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2121600">So it looks like this on the schedule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2124460">Of course we have time going that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2126940">So that's Boston to LAX.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2133836">Now your job is to determine if they can fly this schedule</span> <span m="2139870">with four aircraft?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2142610">And naturally you don't want to over use any one aircraft,</span> <span m="2145065">because you would like to have even wear on them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148080">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148840">So as you make your choices, you'll rotate the aircraft.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2153090">So you'll assign to this one to A1, aircraft number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2158140">This one will be A2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2160160">This one will be A3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2162380">And this one will be A4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2165160">And, oops, there's no aircraft left for the flight to Los</span> <span m="2169370">Angeles, because you only have four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2172240">So, it's obvious, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2173410">This is 100%, exactly, the map coloring problem, even down to</span> <span m="2178450">the four choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180380">Because, you have the constraint, the no single</span> <span m="2184050">physical aircraft can fly two flights at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189300">Just like no two adjacent states can</span> <span m="2190920">be colored the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2192820">So there's a no same time constraint, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2205170">So if you were assigning aircraft to these flights, you</span> <span m="2209620">would get down to F4, the fourth flight, and you would</span> <span m="2213040">say, well, let's see, this guy down here can be</span> <span m="2219310">A1, A2, A3, or A4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220570">But if I choose A4 for that fourth flight, then there</span> <span m="2223700">would be nothing left in its domain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2227540">So you've thus set the problem up to be identical to the map</span> <span m="2234640">coloring problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2235540">And, of course, you can enrich it with other kinds of</span> <span m="2238100">constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239370">So, for example, you might have--</span> <span m="2241190">this is a not same time constraint--</span> <span m="2251040">and these, I mean, this is at JFK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2256030">And it flies out of JFK, so maybe you can use the same</span> <span m="2260590">aircraft for those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2261670">But not if they're right up against each other, because</span> <span m="2263550">you have a minimum ground time rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2266110">So there's a minimum ground time constraint here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2270650">And there's a minimum ground time constraint here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2275400">There's a minimum ground time constraint here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282030">And if these are at the same city, then you've got to allow</span> <span m="2285310">enough time for them to fly between the two cities that</span> <span m="2287520">are involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2288800">So the constraints can get a little bit more complicated,</span> <span m="2290820">but the idea is the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293430">So you say to me, I don't trust you, show me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2296690">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297660">So let me show you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300620">Oh, by the way, there's one more way to make this map</span> <span m="2302680">coloring problem easier, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2307430">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2308330">The arrangement is going to be alphabetical, the type is</span> <span m="2311770">going to be assignments only, and we know that's a loser.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2317000">But not if we use a whole lot of colors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2322650">So it's the use of four colors that got us into trouble.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2326520">Now that's an aside, but it'll be coming back</span> <span m="2328540">in a moment or two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2329500">Scheduling, here's that problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2332951">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2335110">You can almost see it working just like the</span> <span m="2336910">map coloring thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2338612">But that's maybe too easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2341940">Let's do this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346854">See this is just like [? simplicia. ?]</span> <span m="2350020">We've kind of got a goofy arrangement here that's</span> <span m="2353520">guaranteed to lose at the bottom because of choices made</span> <span m="2356790">at the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358700">But that's OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2359740">We can that we can stop this, and we can change to check</span> <span m="2365370">neighbors only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2367440">And boom, there it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2371830">Or alternatively, let me see if I can do it this way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374220">Most constrained first, type will be assignments only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2378738">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2381210">That worked fine, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384790">So you might choose to have a slightly harder</span> <span m="2387260">problem, like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390920">And we can search away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2398390">Actually I don't know if this will complete or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400420">This is a randomly generated example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2403970">But you're going to lose your summer job if you can't figure</span> <span m="2407060">out whether you can do this, or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2408960">So what are you going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2413175">[? Elliott, ?] you got any thoughts about how you're</span> <span m="2415040">going to save your job?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2418260">So here's the question you've been asked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420850">How many airplanes does Jet Green need?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2426380">And you decide, well, four seemed to work before, so</span> <span m="2430015">we'll try four here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432020">You're not sure if it's going to terminate or not, I mean,</span> <span m="2434980">in your lifetime, let alone in your summer job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442760">[? Elliott, ?] let me give you a hint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2444890">Look at the outline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2448110">The outline up here, on the board, the last item.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2451643">[? ELLIOTT: [INAUDIBLE] ?]</span> <span m="2452610">PROF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2452685">PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, what's that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2457030">What's the maximum number of airplanes we're going to need?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2460380">Suppose we've got five flights, what's the maximum</span> <span m="2464990">number of airplanes we would ever need?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2467040">Five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2468350">What's the minimum number of airplanes we'll need?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2471020">One.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2472750">So let's try it with a small number of airplanes and a</span> <span m="2477510">large number of airplanes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2485430">So that showed us very fast that we can't</span> <span m="2489190">do it with one airplane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2499210">That showed us very fast we can do it with ten airplanes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2503866">SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="2506794">amount of overlappage from up [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2511680">PROF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2511747">PATRICK WINSTON: Volunteer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2515110">What are we going to do to find the actual number, as</span> <span m="2518140">fast as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2519080">And at least give our boss a reasonable answer, even if not</span> <span m="2523110">necessarily the exact number very fast?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527960">It's easy, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528630">We're going to start up here with one computer, and we're</span> <span m="2531840">going to start down here with another computer,</span> <span m="2534850">and see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2536930">So let's see if we can do it with nine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2544240">Let's see if we can do it with eight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2551110">Let's see if we can do it with seven.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2554100">These take almost zero time, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2555600">Because they're under constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2560720">Wow, that's good, seven.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2562130">Let's try six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2563810">Actually let's try two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568790">It loses fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2570580">Let's try three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2581860">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582120">Maybe if you let it run one long enough three will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2585440">I doubt it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2587120">While we're at it though, we might as well go back here and</span> <span m="2589110">try it with six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2589790">Remember seven worked real fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2595000">Gees, six, that was six, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597510">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597870">So let's try it with five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2602650">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2602950">So it runs real fast with five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2604730">It terminates real quick with two, so we got</span> <span m="2607660">three and four left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2609710">So we could tell our boss, a la any time algorithm, that</span> <span m="2613955">you're not real sure, but you know it's going to be either</span> <span m="2615890">three or four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617280">And then, you got two computers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2619270">You can let both run and see if either one terminate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2623120">So you have three and four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2624730">My guess is that three will eventually give up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2629140">But of course, there's another little problem here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2631040">We haven't used the most constraint first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2633700">If we did that, we might be able to do it even faster.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2636520">Actually, I don't think I can make that switch without</span> <span m="2639620">getting another random assignment, but</span> <span m="2641810">let's see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2644320">Maybe so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2645950">SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="2650180">PROF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2650266">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, I already had most constraint first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2652000">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2653370">So it didn't help to actually switch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2655660">And I think I've got a new schedule to work here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2658750">So that's the end of the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661190">You can do good resource allocation if you do several</span> <span m="2665250">things are once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666510">Number one, you always want to use most constraint first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2669450">Number two you want to propagate through domains</span> <span m="2671350">produced to a single algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2673050">And number three, if you really try to figure out what</span> <span m="2675380">the minimum number of resources needed is, you do</span> <span m="2679086">this under over business and you can quickly converge on a</span> <span m="2682380">narrow range where the search is taking a long time, and be</span> <span m="2685550">sure that it lies within that narrow range.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2689310">Because when you over resource, it's fast to</span> <span m="2692330">complete, and when you under resource,</span> <span m="2694670">it's fast to terminate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2697180">So you can just squeeze it right down into</span> <span m="2699180">a very small range.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2700600">And that is the end of the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2702270">Enjoy your holiday on Monday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2703700">We'll have two classes next week on Wednesday and Friday,</span> <span m="2708660">as advertised.</span> </p>

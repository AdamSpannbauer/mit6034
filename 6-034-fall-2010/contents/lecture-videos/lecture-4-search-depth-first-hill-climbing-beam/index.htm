<p><strong>Description:</strong> This lecture covers algorithms for depth-first and breadth-first search, followed by several refinements: keeping track of nodes already considered, hill climbing, and beam search.  We end with a brief discussion of commonsense vs. reflective knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Patrick H. Winston</p>

<p><span m="9234">PATRICK WINSTON: Today we're going to be</span> <span m="10220">talking about Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="11030">I know you're going to turn blue with yet</span> <span m="13220">another lecture on Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="15350">Those of you who are taking computer science subjects,</span> <span m="18270">you've probably seen in 601.</span> </p>
<p><span m="20360">You'll see it again as theory course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="22270">But we're going to do it for a little different purpose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="25570">I want you to develop some intuition about various kinds</span> <span m="29480">of Search work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="31080">And I want to talk a little bit about Search as a model of</span> <span m="35800">what goes on in our heads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="38080">And toward the end, if there's time, I'd like to do a</span> <span m="40630">demonstration for you of something never before</span> <span m="43660">demonstrated to a 603.4 class, because it was only completed</span> <span m="49960">last spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="51600">And some finishing touches were added by me this morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="56470">Always dangerous, but we'll see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="61430">There's Cambridge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="63870">You all recognize it, of course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="68230">You might want to get from some starting position s to</span> <span m="71550">some goal position g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="74280">So, you'll hire a cab and hope for the best.</span> </p>
<p><span m="78490">So, here's what might happen, not too hot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="91430">Let's move the starting position over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="101250">I've had cab drivers like this New York.</span> </p>
<p><span m="107039">But it's not a very good path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="108460">It's the path of a thief.</span> </p>
<p><span m="110400">Let's change the way that the search is done to that of a</span> <span m="114930">beginner, an honest beginner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="121690">Not too bad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="124100">Now, let's have a look at how the Search would happen if the</span> <span m="129360">cab driver was a Ph.D. in physics</span> <span m="133440">after his third post-doc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145800">These are not actually traverse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="146750">These are just things that the driver is thinking about, and</span> <span m="151050">that is the very best of all possible paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="154840">So, the thief does a horrible job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="156480">The beginner does a pretty good job, but</span> <span m="158110">not an optimal job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="159960">This is the optimal job as produced by the Ph.D. in</span> <span m="164790">physics after his third post-doc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="168910">So, would you like to understand how those all work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="171230">The answer, of course, is yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="176660">I'm going to talk to you about procedures that are different</span> <span m="181070">from the way that you just solved this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="185260">I imagine that if I said to you, please find a path for s</span> <span m="188420">to g, you would, within a few seconds, find</span> <span m="192020">a pretty good path--</span> <span m="193070">not the optimal one, but a pretty good one--</span> <span m="195710">using your eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="198050">And we're not going to tell you about how that works,</span> <span m="199940">because we don't know how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="202540">But we do know that problem solving with the eyes is an</span> <span m="207030">important part of our total intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="209260">And we'll never have a complete theory of human</span> <span m="211260">intelligence until we can understand the contributions</span> <span m="214640">of the human visual system to solving everyday problems like</span> <span m="218990">finding a pretty good path in that map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="223470">But, alas, we can't talk about that, because we don't know</span> <span m="225870">how to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227100">We're working on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="228820">But we don't know how to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="231450">So, I'm not going to use Cambridge in my illustrations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="233880">There's too much there to work through in an hour.</span> </p>
<p><span m="236860">So, we're going to use this map over here which has been</span> <span m="239620">designed to illustrate a few important points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="242850">You, too, can find a path through that graph pretty</span> <span m="246520">easily with your eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="248570">Our programs don't have eyes, and they don't have visually</span> <span m="251320">grounded algorithms, so they're going to have to do</span> <span m="253280">something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="254720">And the very first kind of search we want to talk about</span> <span m="257180">is called the British Museum approach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="259980">This is a slur against at least the British Museum, if</span> <span m="263100">not the entire nation, because the way you do a British</span> <span m="266400">Museum search is you find every possible path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="270230">So, it'll be helpful to have a diagram of all possible paths</span> <span m="273310">on the board.</span> </p>
<p><span m="274409">We're going to start with a British Museum search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="281930">From the starting position, it's clear, you can go from my</span> <span m="285130">s to either a or b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="292400">And already there's an important quiz point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="294600">Whenever we have these kinds of problems on a quiz, we ask</span> <span m="298260">you to develop the tree associated with a search in</span> <span m="302720">lexical order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="304470">So, the nodes there under s are listed alphabetically,</span> <span m="311600">just to have an orderly way of doing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="314710">So, from a we can go either b or d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="322020">And another convention of the subject, another thing you</span> <span m="324940">have to keep in mind in quizzes, is it we don't have</span> <span m="327530">these searches bite their own tail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="330180">So, I could have said that if I'm at a, I can</span> <span m="333400">also go back to s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="335570">But no path is ever allowed them to bite itself, to go</span> <span m="340730">around and enter and get back to a place that's</span> <span m="345190">already on the path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="347580">Now if I go on to b first, that means that from b I can</span> <span m="352750">go to either a or c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="355600">This is getting fat pretty fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357020">But let's see, s, a, b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="359570">The only place I can go is c and then to e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="363930">s, a, d, without biting my own tail and going back to a, the</span> <span m="367360">only place I can go is g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="370290">s b, a, I can only go to d and then to g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="376820">And finally, s, b, c, I can only go to e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="381040">So, that is a complete set of paths as produced by any</span> <span m="386190">program that you will feel you'd like to write that finds</span> <span m="391720">all possible paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="393470">I haven't been very precise about how to do that, because</span> <span m="396780">you don't have to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="398350">You can't save much work by being clever, because you have</span> <span m="400780">to find everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="403570">So, that's the British Museum expansion of the tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="417230">So, what have I done?</span> </p>
<p><span m="418409">I've been playing around with a map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="419820">I showed you an example of a map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421550">And pretty soon you're going to think that</span> <span m="425310">Search is about maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="428616">So, before going even another tiny step, I want to emphasize</span> <span m="434820">that Search is not equal to maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="438030">Search is about choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="439600">And I happen to illustrate these searches with maps,</span> <span m="442690">because they are particularly cogent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="445390">But Search is not about maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="446790">It's about the choices you make when you're trying to</span> <span m="448800">make decisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="450800">These things I'm going to be talking to you about today are</span> <span m="454470">choices you make when you explore the map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="457172">You can make other kinds of choices when you're exploring</span> <span m="459630">other kinds of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="460630">And, in fact, at the end, if there's time, I'll show you</span> <span m="464500">how you do searches when you're solving problems in a</span> <span m="467130">humanities class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="471000">That's the British Museum algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="472409">Search is not about maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="473950">Our first gold star idea, Search is about choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="478240">But for our illustration, Search is about maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="480660">So, the first kind of Search we want to talk about that's</span> <span m="483530">real is Depth-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="490412">And the idea of Depth-first Search is that you barrel</span> <span m="495500">ahead in a single-minded way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="500160">So, from s, your choices are a or b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="507832">And you always go down the left branch by convention.</span> </p>
<p><span m="511730">So, from s, we go to a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="515350">From a we have two choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="516919">We can go to either b or d following our lexical</span> <span m="526990">convention.</span> </p>
<p><span m="529630">After that, we can go to c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532660">And after that we can go to e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="534660">And too bad for us, we're stuck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="538871">What are we going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="540520">We've got into a dead end, all is lost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="544790">But of course, all isn't lost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546640">Because we have the choice of backing up to the place where</span> <span m="551180">we last made a decision and choosing another branch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="556280">So, that process is called variously back-up or</span> <span m="560350">backtracking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="563330">At this point, we would say, ah, dead end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="566670">The first place we find when we back up the tree where we</span> <span m="570110">made a choice is when we chose b instead of d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="574070">So, we go back up there and take the other route.</span> </p>
<p><span m="579060">s, a, d now goes to g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="582730">And we're done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="585220">We're going to make up a little table here of things</span> <span m="587220">that we can embellish our basic searches with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="590880">And one of the things we can embellish our basic searches</span> <span m="593420">with is this backtracking idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="601700">Now, backtrack is not relevant to the British Museum</span> <span m="604410">algorithm, because you've got to find everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="607120">You can't quit when you've found one path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610000">But you'd always want to use backtracking with Depth-first</span> <span m="612940">Search, because you may plunge on down and miss the path that</span> <span m="616140">gets to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="618050">Now, you might ask me, is backtracking, therefore,</span> <span m="622480">always part of Depth-first Search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="625330">And you can read textbooks that do it either way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="628350">Count on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="629190">If we give you a Search problem on a quiz, we'll tell</span> <span m="632500">you whether or not your Search is supposed to use</span> <span m="634400">backtracking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="634990">We consider it to be an optional thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="638200">You'd be pretty stupid not to use this optional thing when</span> <span m="640320">you're doing Depth-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="641925">But we'll separate these ideas out and call</span> <span m="644800">it an optional add-on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="647300">so, that's Depth-first Search, very simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="651600">Now, the natural companion to Depth-first Search will be</span> <span m="655670">Breadth-first Search, Breadth-first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="667640">And the way it works is you build up this tree level by</span> <span m="671620">level, and at some point, when you scan across a level,</span> <span m="676160">you'll find that you've completed a path</span> <span m="677790">that goes to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680100">So, level by level, s can go to either a or b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="687310">a can go either to b or d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="690670">And b can go to either a or c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="694620">So, you see what we're doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="695480">We're going level by level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="698030">And we haven't hit a level with a goal in it yet, so</span> <span m="700360">we've got to keep going.</span> </p>
<p><span m="702510">Note that we're building up quite a bit of stuff here,</span> <span m="704800">quite a lot of growth in the size of the path set that</span> <span m="709360">we're keeping in mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="711540">At the next level, we have b going to c, d going to g, a</span> <span m="716850">going to d, and c going to e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="721030">And now, when we scan across, we do hit g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="725460">So, we found a path with Breadth-first Search, just as</span> <span m="728530">we found a path with Depth-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="732650">Now, you might say, well, why didn't you just quit</span> <span m="734360">when you hit g?</span> </p>
<p><span m="735420">Implementation detail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738340">We'll talk about a sample implementation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="740830">You can write it in any way you want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="742990">But now that we know what these searches are, let's</span> <span m="746080">speed things up a little bit here and do a couple searches</span> <span m="751560">that now have names.</span> </p>
<p><span m="754530">The first type will be Depth-first, boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758590">That's the one that produces the thief path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="763870">And then we can also do a Breadth-first Search, which we</span> <span m="766070">haven't tried yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="767310">What do you suppose is going to happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="769350">Is it going to be fast, slow, produce a good path,</span> <span m="773030">produce a bad path?</span> </p>
<p><span m="773840">I don't know, let's try it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="776095">I had to speed it up, you see, because it's doing an awful</span> <span m="778410">lot of Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="779670">It's generating an awful lot of paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="788420">Finally, you got a path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790280">Is it the best path?</span> </p>
<p><span m="791030">I don't think so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="791680">But we're not going to talk about optimal paths today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="793700">We're just going to talk about pretty good</span> <span m="795730">paths, heuristic paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="798330">Let's move the starting position here in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801545">Do you think Breadth-first Search is going to be stupid?</span> </p>
<p><span m="805050">I think it's going to be pretty stupid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="806310">Let's see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="808730">This Search is a lot to the left, which you would never do</span> <span m="810840">with you eye.</span> </p>
<p><span m="811795">Let me slow that down just to demonstrate it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815050">It finds a shorter path, because it's right there in</span> <span m="817190">the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="818470">But it spends a lot of its time looking off to the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="821810">It's pretty stupid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="824740">But that's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="826810">So, now that we've got two examples of searches on the</span> <span m="829760">table, I'd like to just write a little flow chart for how</span> <span m="832460">the search might work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="834800">Because if I do that, then it'll be easier for us to see</span> <span m="838710">what kind of small differences there are between the</span> <span m="840600">implementations of these various searches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844550">So, what we're going to do is we're going to develop a</span> <span m="847500">waiting list, a queue, a line, whatever you'd</span> <span m="851020">like to call it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="851180">Let's call if a queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852380">We're going to develop a queue of paths that are under</span> <span m="854590">consideration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856960">So, the first step in our algorithm will be to</span> <span m="860120">initialize our queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="869410">And I think what I'll do is I'll simulate Depth-first</span> <span m="873550">Search on this problem up there on the</span> <span m="877780">left using this algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880500">I need to have some way of representing my paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="883890">And what I want to do is I'm going to betray my heritage as</span> <span m="886960">a list programmer, because I'm just going to put these up as</span> <span m="889720">if there were lisp s-expressions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="892320">To begin with, I just have one path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="895140">And it has only one node in it, s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="898710">That's the whole path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901400">The next thing I do after I initialize the queue is I</span> <span m="906890">extend first path on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="924750">OK, when I extend s, I get two paths.</span> </p>
<p><span m="930300">I get s goes to a, and I get s goes to b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="938670">I take the first one off the front of the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="941460">And I put back the two that are produced by</span> <span m="944320">extending that path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="947070">Now, after I've extended the first path on the queue, I</span> <span m="950130">have to but those extended paths on to the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="956820">In here there's an explicit step where I've checked to see</span> <span m="959200">if that first path is a winner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="961620">If it's not, I extend it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="963710">And I have to put those paths onto the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="967950">So, I'll say that what I do is I end queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="978390">Now, I've done one step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="979950">And let's let me do another step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="981160">I'm going to take this first path off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="984190">I'm going to extend that path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="987580">And where do I put these new paths on the queue if I'm</span> <span m="990760">doing Depth-first Search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="994320">Well, I want to work with the path that I've just generated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998390">I'm taking this plunge down deep into the search tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1003800">So, since I want to keep going down into the stuff that I</span> <span m="1007290">just generated, where then do I want to put these two paths?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1011440">At the end of the queue?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1012360">I don't think so, because it'll be a long</span> <span m="1014430">time getting there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1015370">I want to put them on the front of the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020920">For Depth-first Search, I want to put them on the</span> <span m="1032858">front of the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1035220">And that's why s, a, b goes here, and s, a, d, and then</span> <span m="1044510">that's s, b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1049770">So, s, b is still there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1051100">That's still a valid possibility.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1053550">But now I've stuck two paths in front of it, both of the</span> <span m="1055830">ones I generated by taking a path off the front of the</span> <span m="1059060">queue, discovering that it doesn't go to the goal,</span> <span m="1062310">extending it and putting those back on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066130">I might as well complete this illustration here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1069210">While I'm at it, I take the s, a, b off, s, a, b, and I can</span> <span m="1077070">go only there to c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1079840">But, of course, I keep s, a, d and s, b on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1089170">Now, I take the front off the queue again, and I get s, a,</span> <span m="1092860">b, c, e, and not to forget s, a, d and s, b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1103330">I take the first one off the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105340">It doesn't go to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1107900">I try to extend it, but there's nothing there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1110000">I've reached a dead end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1112080">So, in this operation, all I'm doing is taking the front one</span> <span m="1114670">off the queue and shortening the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1122030">We're almost home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1123860">I take s, a,d off of queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1125870">And I get s, a, d, c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1130160">And, of course, I still have s, b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1134300">Now, the next time I visit the situation, buried in that</span> <span m="1140650">first step, I discover a path that actually does get to</span> <span m="1144150">goal, and I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1146920">So, each time around I visualize the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150810">I check to see if I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152320">If not, I take the extensions and put them</span> <span m="1155840">somewhere on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1157606">And then I go back in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165000">And then here there's a varied test which checks to see if</span> <span m="1169900">we're done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1172280">That's how the Depth-first Search algorithm works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176650">And now, would we have to start all over again if we did</span> <span m="1179070">Breadth-first Search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1181780">Nope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1182310">Same algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1184220">All the code we've got needs one line</span> <span m="1186110">replaced, one line changed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189060">What do I have to do different in order to get a</span> <span m="1191080">Breadth-first Search out of this instead of</span> <span m="1192800">a Depth-first Search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1194580">Tanya?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1195440">TANYA: Change [INAUDIBLE] on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1196930">PATRICK WINSTON: And where do I put it on the queue?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1197940">She says to change it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1198840">TANYA: On the back?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1199720">PATRICK WINSTON: Put it on the back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1202030">So, with Breadth-first Search all I have to do</span> <span m="1214810">is put on the back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1221290">Now, if we were content with a inefficient search, and didn't</span> <span m="1228990">care much about how good our path was, we'd be done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1231350">And we could go home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233330">But we are a little concerned about the</span> <span m="1235690">efficiency of our search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1237740">And we would like a pretty good path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1239820">So, we're going to have to stick around</span> <span m="1241630">for a little while.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1245290">Now, you may have noticed, up there in that the development</span> <span m="1249770">of the Breadth-first Search, that the algorithm is</span> <span m="1257180">incredibly stupid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1261300">Why is the algorithm incredibly stupid?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266000">Ty, what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1267200">TY: It can't tell whether it's getting closer or further away</span> <span m="1269189">from the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1269540">PATRICK WINSTON: It certainly can't tell whether it's</span> <span m="1271090">getting closer or further away from the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273330">And we're going to deal with that in a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276090">But it's even stupider than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1280880">Why is it stupid?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1281540">What's your name?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282474">DYLAN: Dylan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1284342">It [? hits ?] the same nodes twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1286677">PATRICK WINSTON: Dylan said it's extending paths that go</span> <span m="1290340">to the same node more than once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1293660">Let's see what Dylan's talking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1299410">Down here, it extends a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1302522">But it's already extended a up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1306810">Down here, it extends a path that goes to b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1311440">And it's already extended a path that goes to d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314900">Over here, it could extend a path that went through c, but</span> <span m="1322170">it's already got a path that goes through c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1325800">So, all of these paths are duplicated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1329450">And we're still going through them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1332040">That's incredibly stupid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1335450">What we're going to do is we're going to amend our</span> <span m="1337460">algorithm just a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1343940">And we're not going to extend the first path on the queue</span> <span m="1351210">unless final node never before extended.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1376550">What we're going to do is we're going to look to see if</span> <span m="1378380">there-- we've got this path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1379780">And we're going to extend it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380930">And it's got a final note.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382190">If we've ever extended a path that goes to that final node,</span> <span m="1385700">and it was a final node on that path, then we're not</span> <span m="1387580">going to do it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389630">We got to keep a list of places that have already been</span> <span m="1396520">the last piece of a path that was extended.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399506">Everybody got that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1400830">It's a little awkward to say it, because it's the last node</span> <span m="1404130">we care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1404870">If a path terminates in a node, and if some other path</span> <span m="1410640">previously terminated in that node and got extended--</span> <span m="1413480">we're not going to do it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1414570">Because it's a waste of time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419690">Now, let's see if this actually helps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1431470">Now, use the extended list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1433200">Let's see, well, gee, we got that place</span> <span m="1440305">in the center there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1441050">Let's just repeat the previous search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1455200">Wow, it's taking a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1457200">But notice it put 103 paths back on the queue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1462610">Now, let's add a filter and try again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1479540">A lot less.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1481640">So, let's speed this up, and we'll start way over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1486950">You remember how tedious that search was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489390">And now we'll repeat it with this list, boom, there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495240">That's all because we didn't do that silly thing of going</span> <span m="1498050">back through the final node that's</span> <span m="1501610">already been gone through.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1504170">So, you would never not want to do this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1507380">We better list this as another option.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1519846">It doesn't help with a British Museum algorithm, because</span> <span m="1522420">nothing helps with the British Museum algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1524670">Does it help with Depth-first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1525950">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526800">Does it help with Breadth-first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1528350">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1529680">Do we do backtracking with Breadth-first?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532000">No, because backtracking can't do us any good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1538870">OK, we're almost, except that search that's starting in the</span> <span m="1543990">middle is still pretty stupid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546090">Both the Breadth-first version and the Depth-first version</span> <span m="1552200">are going off to the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1553940">And we would never do that with our eyes in any case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1558320">The next thing we want to do is we want to have ourselves a</span> <span m="1561720">slightly more informed search by taking into consideration</span> <span m="1567020">whether we seem to be getting anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1573490">So, in general, it's a good thing to get closer to where</span> <span m="1577550">we want to go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1579890">In general, if we've got a choice of going to a node</span> <span m="1584200">that's close to the goal or a node that's not so close to</span> <span m="1587210">the goal, we'll always want to go to the one that's</span> <span m="1588830">close to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1591010">And as soon as we add that to what we're doing, we have</span> <span m="1595610">another kind of Search, which goes by the</span> <span m="1607290">name of Hill Climbing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1616900">And it's just like Depth-first Search, except instead of</span> <span m="1619830">using lexical order to break ties, we're going to break</span> <span m="1623540">ties according to which node is closer to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629720">I went to some trouble to talk to you about</span> <span m="1631260">this enqueued list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632680">And having gone to that trouble, I'm now</span> <span m="1634020">going to ignore it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1635860">Not because it isn't a good idea, but because trying to</span> <span m="1638260">keep track of everything in the example is</span> <span m="1640490">confusing the example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641310">It won't work out right in the small example and all that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1644350">Put the queueing thing aside, queued list aside, and think</span> <span m="1648270">instead just about the value of going in the direction</span> <span m="1653120">that's getting us closer to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1656820">In Hill Climbing Search, just like a Depth-first Search, we</span> <span m="1660520">have a and b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1662790">And we're still going to list them lexically on underneath</span> <span m="1665800">the parent node.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667636">But now which one is so closer to the goal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1673630">Now, this time b is closer to the goal than a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1676620">So, instead of following the Depth-first course, which</span> <span m="1679340">would take us down through a, we're going to go to the one</span> <span m="1682030">that's closest which goes through b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1684890">And b can either go to a or c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694670">b is six units away from the goal. a is about seven plus,</span> <span m="1699040">not drawn exactly to scale.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700620">Use the numbers not your eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1705420">Now where are we?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1706740">It's symmetric, so a and c are both equally</span> <span m="1708990">far from the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1710920">Now we're going to use the lexical order</span> <span m="1712220">to break the tie.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714160">Now from s, b, a, we'll go to d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1721510">And now, which is closest to the goal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724190">That's the only choice we have.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725340">So, now we have no choice but to go down to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1729050">That's the Hill Climbing way of doing the search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1733250">And notice that this time there's no backtracking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1737740">It's not the optimal path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1739270">It's not the best path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1739940">But at least there's no backtracking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742010">That's not always true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742830">That's just an artifact of this particular example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1747180">Do you think Hill Climbing would produce a faster search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1750910">I think so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753030">Let's see what happens when we add these</span> <span m="1755040">things at one at a time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1757570">First, let's turn off our extended list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1765610">We turned off our extended list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1767010">And we're going to do Depth-first again just for the</span> <span m="1769980">sake of comparison.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1773040">It produces a very roundabout path with 48 enqueueings.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1778460">Now, let's switch over to Hill Climbing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1781230">And what do think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1781780">Do you think it will produce a straighter path, fewer</span> <span m="1784630">enqueueings?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1786720">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789930">You wouldn't not want to do that, would you?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1792180">If you've got some kind of heuristic that tells you that</span> <span m="1795450">you're getting close to the goal, you should use it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1798360">Now, it's easy to modify my example over there so that</span> <span m="1803330">getting close to the goal gets you trapped in a</span> <span m="1805550">blind alley on e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1806690">That's easy to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808730">But that's just an artifact of the example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810280">In general, you want to go along a path that gets you</span> <span m="1813130">closer to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815060">So, that's 23.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1816040">I don't know, let's see if using the extended list filter</span> <span m="1818400">does any good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1821870">Yeah, still 23.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823360">So, in that particular case the extension list didn't</span> <span m="1830670">actually do us any good, because we're driving so</span> <span m="1833190">directly toward the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1836960">OK, that's that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1838740">Now, let's see, is there any analog to--</span> <span m="1842410">well, we might say that this is yet another way of</span> <span m="1847580">distinguishing the searches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1849750">And that is, is it an informed search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1860620">Is it making use of any kind of heuristic information?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1863540">Certainly, a British Museum is not, Depth is</span> <span m="1865640">not, Breadth is not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1867530">And now let's consider what we got for Hill Climbing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1869980">Do we want to use backtracking?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1871240">Sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872410">Do we want to use an enqueued list?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1874010">Sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1875650">And it is informed, because it's taking advantage of this</span> <span m="1878210">extra information.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1878800">It may not be in your problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1880500">It's not often the case you've got this information in a map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884570">Your problem may not have any heuristic measurement of</span> <span m="1888040">distance to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1889325">In which case, you can't do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1891090">But if you've got it, you should use it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1893980">Oh, yeah, there's one more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1895550">And I've already given it away by having it on my chart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1900020">It's called Beam Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1901110">And just as Hill Climbing is an analog of Depth-first</span> <span m="1906210">Search, Beam Search is a complement or addition of an</span> <span m="1911770">informing heuristic to Breadth-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1915140">What you do is you start off just like</span> <span m="1916880">Breadth-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1921190">But you say I'm going to limit the number of paths I'm going</span> <span m="1925230">to consider at any level to some small, fixed number,</span> <span m="1929550">like, in this case, how about two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1932530">So, I'm going to say that I have a Beam of</span> <span m="1935970">two for my Beam Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1945530">Otherwise, I proceed just like Breadth-first</span> <span m="1949080">Search, b, d, a, g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1956230">And now I've got that stupid thing where I'm duplicating my</span> <span m="1958880">nodes, because I'm forgetting about the enqueued list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1962110">But to illustrate Beam Search, what about I'm going to do now</span> <span m="1964760">is I'm going to take all these paths I've got at the second</span> <span m="1967080">level, and I'm only going to keep the best two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969190">That's my beam width.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1971130">And the best two are the two that get closest to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1974220">So, those four, b, c, a, and d, which two get</span> <span m="1978430">closest to the goal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979945">Now, b and d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1982160">These guys are trimmed off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985530">I'm only keeping two at every level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1988030">Now, going down from b and d, I have, at the next</span> <span m="1991690">level, c and g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1994250">And now I've found the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1995860">So, I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997790">We could do that here, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2002750">We could choose a Beam Search, not bad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2012350">Let's see, let's try this thing from the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2014940">Let's slow my speed down a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2017530">Now, are we going to see anything going off to the left</span> <span m="2019853">like we did with ordinary Breadth-first Search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2024950">No, because it's smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2027640">It doesn't say, I want to go to a place that's further away</span> <span m="2029780">from my goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033870">Now, let's see, maybe we can go back to our algorithm now</span> <span m="2037940">and talk about that enqueueing mechanism and</span> <span m="2047620">talk about Hill Climbing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057170">Can I use the same basic search mechanism, just change</span> <span m="2061060">that one line again?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2062199">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2063570">How do I add new paths to the queue this time?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2067199">Well, it's very much like Hill Climbing, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2069210">I want to add them to the front but</span> <span m="2071880">with one little flourish.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072960">What's the flourish?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2074210">[? Krishna, ?] what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2076460">Remember, I want to use my heuristic information.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079500">So, I not only add them to the front, but amongst the ones</span> <span m="2081900">I'm adding to the front, what do I do?</span> </p>

<p><span m="2085850">And how do you arrange them?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2087120">AUDIENCE:[? You ?]</span> <span m="2087958">[? keep the ?] minimum [? first. ?]</span> <span m="2089219">PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, you can put the minimum</span> <span m="2091570">first if you like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2092290">But let's sort them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2093739">We'll sort them, that will keep everything straight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2096520">So Hill Climbing is front-sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113370">And, finally, how about Beam?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2114580">What do we do with Beam Search to add them to the queue?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2117860">Well, it doesn't matter where we add them, because all we're</span> <span m="2121175">going to do is we're going to keep the w best.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2125840">So, with Beam, we'll just abbreviate that by</span> <span m="2130270">saying keep w best.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2141330">Now, you have some of the basic</span> <span m="2143870">searches in you're toolkit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2146450">There's one more that's sometimes talked about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148800">We've got Depth, Breadth, Best, and Beam, one more is</span> <span m="2153710">Best, Best-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2157720">It's a variant where you say, I've got this tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164250">It's got a bunch of paths that terminate in leaves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2168270">Let me just always work on the leaf node that's</span> <span m="2170510">closest to the goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2172790">It can skip around a little bit from one place to another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2175510">Because as it pursues one path, it may not do very well</span> <span m="2178490">in some other path quite distant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180350">And the tree will become the best one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2184710">We've actually seen an instance of that in then</span> <span m="2188930">integration program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190690">It's capable of skipping all over the place, because it's</span> <span m="2192840">always taking the easiest problem in the search tree, in</span> <span m="2197950">the and/or tree, working on that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199940">That's Best-first Search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2203300">You can do these sorts of things in</span> <span m="2204340">continuous spaces, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2206780">And you've done the mathematics of</span> <span m="2207830">that in 1802 or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2212580">But in continuous spaces, the Hill Climbing sometimes leads</span> <span m="2216190">to problems or doesn't do very well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219470">What kind of a problem can you encounter in a continuous</span> <span m="2224140">space with Hill Climbing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2228210">Well, how would you do Hill Climbing in</span> <span m="2231726">a continuous space?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2232840">Let's say we're in the mountains, and a big</span> <span m="2236550">fog has come up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2238500">We're trying to get to the top of the hill before</span> <span m="2240470">we freeze to death.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2242720">And we take a few steps north, a few steps east, west, and</span> <span m="2248006">south using our compass.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250380">And we check to see which direction seems to be doing</span> <span m="2253510">the best job of getting us moving upward.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2257220">And that's our Hill Climbing approach, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2259140">We have explored four directions we can go and pick</span> <span m="2263700">the best one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2265180">And from there, we pick four, try all those, pick the best</span> <span m="2267940">one, and away we go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2268800">We've got ourselves a Hill Climbing algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271180">What's wrong with it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2273210">Or what can be wrong with it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2274710">Sometimes it works just fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2276840">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277330">SPEAKER 1: You might get stuck in a local maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2279605">PATRICK WINSTON: We might get stuck in a local maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282320">So, problem letter a is that if this is your space, it may</span> <span m="2290590">look like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2291450">And you may get stuck on a local maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2296640">Is there any other kind of problem that can come up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2306215">Well, it all depends on what the space is like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2308820">Here's a problem where the space has local maxima.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2313230">Now, a lot of people have been killed on Mt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2315010">Washington when the fog comes up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2318000">And they do freeze to death, why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2323270">The reason they freeze to death is the Hill Climbing</span> <span m="2327440">fails them, and they can't get to the top</span> <span m="2329080">to the ranger station.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2330960">And the reason is that there are large lawns on the</span> <span m="2333660">shoulders of Mt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2334230">Washington.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2334580">It's quite flat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2337140">So, it's the telephone pole problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2342090">That space looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346120">Well, this isn't what Mt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2347040">Washington looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2347910">But it's the telephone pole problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2350620">So, when you're wandering around here, the idea of</span> <span m="2354370">trying a few directions and picking the one that's best</span> <span m="2357720">doesn't help any, because it's flat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2360210">That can be a problem with Hill Climbing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2363090">Now, there's one more problem with Hill Climbing that most</span> <span m="2366160">people don't know about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2369000">But it works like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374600">This is a particularly acute problem in</span> <span m="2376210">high dimensional spaces.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2377280">I'll illustrate it here just in two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2379110">And I'm going to switch from a regular kind of view to a</span> <span m="2384370">contour map.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386570">So, my contour map is going to betray the presence of a sharp</span> <span m="2394950">bridge along the 45 degree line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404050">Now you see how you can get in trouble there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407500">You get in trouble, because if you take a step in each</span> <span m="2410280">direction, every direction takes you downhill.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2413350">And you think you're at the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415610">So, suppose you're right here and you go north.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2419826">That takes you down over a contour line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424180">If you go south, that also takes you down</span> <span m="2427550">over contour lines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2429000">Likewise, going west and east all appear to be taking you</span> <span m="2433870">down, whereas, in fact, you're climbing a ridge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2438015">And that contour line is the highest that I've shown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442270">So, sometimes you can get fooled--</span> <span m="2443900">not stuck, but fooled-- into thinking you're at the top</span> <span m="2446000">when you're actually not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2449830">Now, this is a model something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2454410">This subject is about modeling intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2458130">And this is a kind of algorithm you frequently need</span> <span m="2461680">in order to build an intelligent system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2464580">But do we have any kind of Search happening in our heads?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2471650">If we're going to model what goes on inside our heads, do</span> <span m="2473820">we have to model any kind of searching in order to do the</span> <span m="2479850">kinds of things that we humans do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2484010">I suppose so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2484720">Anytime we make a plan, we're actually evaluating a bunch of</span> <span m="2488250">choices and seeing how they work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2491340">Let me see if I can illustrate it another way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2497120">This is a system that I showed you a little bit of last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2502260">And, shoot, I might as well review one or two things here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2511970">I showed you a Macbeth story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2513640">This is the story I showed you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2516220">And if you had this in a humanities class, the simplest</span> <span m="2519500">questions that might be asked is why did Macduff kill</span> <span m="2524620">Macbeth down there at the bottom?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528240">Did I demonstrate the answering of questions last</span> <span m="2530960">time, or just the development of the graph?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533340">I can't remember.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2534000">But we'll do it again, anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2536210">This is somewhat stylized English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539895">Just so you'll know, it doesn't have</span> <span m="2542570">to be stylized English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543660">This is English that's made available to the Genesis</span> <span m="2547330">system by way of something called Story Workbench.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2551950">There's no free lunch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2552800">Either you can use your human resources to rewrite the plot</span> <span m="2555740">in third grade English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2557540">Or you can use your human resources to take a more</span> <span m="2559940">natural, adult-type version of the story and decorate it with</span> <span m="2563240">annotations that make it possible to absorb it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2566510">Just this summer, in a miracle of summer [? Europe, ?]</span> <span m="2569970">[? Brit ?]</span> <span m="2570313">[? van ?]</span> <span m="2570656">[? Zijp-- ?]</span> <span m="2571280">one of you--</span> <span m="2572790">connected these two systems together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2574630">So, we can now work with stories that are expressed in</span> <span m="2577030">pretty natural English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2579140">Everything in our system is expressed in English,</span> <span m="2582890">including common sense knowledge--</span> <span m="2584230">like if somebody kills you, you're dead--</span> <span m="2586810">but more importantly, for today's illustration, that</span> <span m="2590880">reflective level knowledge, that knowledge about what</span> <span m="2594920">revenge is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597180">Here you are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597790">You're in the humanities class, and someone says,</span> <span m="2600280">what's really going on in the story?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2601800">Not the details of who kills whom, but is</span> <span m="2604420">there a Pyrrhic victory?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2606560">Does somebody have a success?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2608140">Is there an act of revenge?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2610120">These are all kinds of things you might be asked about in</span> <span m="2613380">some kind of humanities class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620470">So, let me fire up the genesis system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2632150">Pray for internet connectivity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2638730">Launch the system on a read of that Macbeth story that I</span> <span m="2642850">showed you just a moment ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2645110">At the moment, it's absorbing information about background</span> <span m="2648220">knowledge, and about reflective level knowledge,</span> <span m="2649960">and all that sort of thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2655780">It's building itself this thing we call</span> <span m="2658010">an elaboration graph.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2660100">It's not quite there yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661320">It's still reading background knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670750">Now it's reading Macbeth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2672140">It's building it's elaboration graph, the same thing you saw</span> <span m="2676100">last time, except not quite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2679060">Do you see that stuff down at the bottom?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2681570">Those are higher level concepts that it's managed to</span> <span m="2684500">find in the Macbeth story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686930">So, its found a revenge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2691010">How did it do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693510">It searched.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2695560">It had a description of what a revenge is, and it looked to</span> <span m="2698810">see if that pattern was exhibited in</span> <span m="2701270">the elaboration graph.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2703420">So, in a combination of things that were said explicitly and</span> <span m="2705940">things that were produced by knee-jerk if/then rules, the</span> <span m="2708650">elaboration graph was sufficiently instantiated that</span> <span m="2711280">the revenge pattern could be found.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2715580">That's interesting, Pyrrhic victory is a little harder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2719030">You'd probably get an a if you said, oh, there's a Pyrrhic</span> <span m="2721070">victory in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724220">There it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2726320">So, I'll blow that up a little bit so you can</span> <span m="2727750">see what that is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729870">You know what a Pyrrhic victory is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2732220">It's a situation where everything seems to be going</span> <span m="2736190">good at first, and then not so hot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741910">So, Macbeth wants to be King down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2746580">And eventually that leads to becoming King.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2748975">But too bad for Macbeth, because eventually he gets</span> <span m="2751610">killed in consequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2752540">So, it's a Pyrrhic victory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754650">All that produced by Search programs who are looking</span> <span m="2756580">through this graph.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2758670">Now once you've got the capability of doing that, of</span> <span m="2761030">course, then you can find all sorts of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2764470">And you can report them in English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765820">But, more interestingly, you can answer questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2769510">Why did Macbeth--</span> <span m="2772060">it cares not a hoot about capitalization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2779920">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: On a common sense level, it looks</span> <span m="2782160">like Dr. Jekyll thinks Macduff killed Macbeth because Macbeth</span> <span m="2784690">angered Macduff on a reflective level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2786520">It looks like Dr. Jekyll thinks Macduff killed Macbeth</span> <span m="2789200">as part of acts of mistake, Pyrrhic victory, and revenge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2792720">PATRICK WINSTON: Pretty corny speech output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795410">But you see the point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2796620">How did it get the stuff on the common sense level?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2800726">The same way all those programs that build goal trees</span> <span m="2803420">report, answers the questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2806600">It's just looking locally around in the connections in</span> <span m="2808687">the goal tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2810410">How did it get the stuff on the reflective level?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2812880">By reporting on the searches that produced information--</span> <span m="2819240">it does that by looking for higher level thoughts about</span> <span m="2823670">its own thoughts and reporting in which of those higher level</span> <span m="2827540">thoughts the incident we asked about actually occurs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2832995">So, let's see, just for fun, we might be interested in why</span> <span m="2837020">Macbeth murdered Duncan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2840660">Wouldn't this be handy if you hadn't actually read the play,</span> <span m="2842600">and here it is, you've got to write that paper?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2845276">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: On a common sense</span> <span m="2846400">level, it looks like--</span> <span m="2847790">PATRICK WINSTON: I'll pull the plug on that, because that's</span> <span m="2849150">just annoying.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2852768">Yeah, pretty good, Macbeth wants to be King, and Duncan</span> <span m="2856340">is the King.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2857620">Let's see, why did Macbeth become King?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2871820">Oh, it won't answer the question</span> <span m="2873450">unless I spell it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2881670">I wouldn't be able to show that to you until last spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2883990">In fact, I wouldn't have been able to show you this today</span> <span m="2887480">until last week with a tweak this morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2890760">Because we've just now connected the language output</span> <span m="2895090">to, of course, [? Cass's ?]</span> <span m="2897910">parser system, which is running in reverse, in order</span> <span m="2899910">to generate that English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901040">So, that's something that has never before been seen by any</span> <span m="2903660">eyes but me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2905830">So, that will conclude what we have to do today.</span> </p>

<p><span m="9660">PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="12360">"Thus Spake Zarathustra" was made famous</span> <span m="15310">and popular by 2001.</span> </p>
<p><span m="18300">And that is music played at this magic moment when some</span> <span m="21840">primate suddenly gets an idea,</span> <span m="24220">presumably one of our ancestors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="28780">So how do we explain all that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="32210">We've got all of the ingredients on the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="34850">And today I want to talk about various ways of putting those</span> <span m="37380">ingredients together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="39200">So we talked about representations, we've talked</span> <span m="41540">about methods, and today we're going to talk about</span> <span m="43860">architectures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="45340">And by the end of the class you'll know how to put one of</span> <span m="50410">those things together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="51270">Actually, no one knows how to put one of</span> <span m="53100">those things together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="53900">But what you will know is about some alternatives for</span> <span m="56750">putting those things together so as to make something that</span> <span m="61992">is arguably intelligent in the same way we are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="68920">So that is our agenda for today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="74240">We'll also talk a little bit more about stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="78475">I think it was in 2007 when the Estonians moved a war</span> <span m="86270">memorial from the center of Tallinn off to</span> <span m="88990">a Russian war cemetery.</span> </p>
<p><span m="93150">Prior to that time the Estonians had been building up</span> <span m="95690">their national computer networks because they thought</span> <span m="97870">that computation was the wave of the future-- networks and</span> <span m="100346">all of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="101870">Shortly after the movement of that war memorial, someone</span> <span m="105920">brought the Estonian national network down--</span> <span m="109604">a cyber attack.</span> </p>
<p><span m="111700">It was widely believed to be the Russians.</span> </p>
<p><span m="115930">There's a large Russian ethnic population in</span> <span m="118330">Estonia to start with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="119539">And the movement of that war memorial</span> <span m="122080">irritated the Russians.</span> </p>
<p><span m="123730">And so everybody everybody thinks that they did it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="126960">But you know what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="127910">No computer can understand the story I just told.</span> </p>
<p><span m="132110">They can revel through all of the worldwide web finding</span> <span m="135610">information that's relevant to that, but no computer can</span> <span m="138829">understand the story I just told, except one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="141710">You'll see a demonstration of that later on today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145300">So by the way, if you're interested in understanding</span> <span m="148620">the nature of intelligence, this is, of course, the most</span> <span m="151480">important lecture of the semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="155020">And I should tell you a little bit about what we're going to</span> <span m="157530">do on Wednesday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="158390">Because for some reason the day before Thanksgiving tends</span> <span m="163470">to be a lecture that's lightly populated,</span> <span m="166510">except in this class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="167980">Because I'm going to talk about the artificial</span> <span m="171820">intelligence business and what can be learned from it about</span> <span m="174340">how to avoid going broke when you start your company.</span> </p>
<p><span m="177579">So for many of you that will be the most important lecture</span> <span m="182760">of the semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="185680">It all started back in the dawn age of artificial</span> <span m="188070">intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="189810">And really, it all started at Carnegie Mellon, sad to say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194020">Because the people at Carnegie Mellon, notably Newell and</span> <span m="196950">Simon, were the first to think about sort of a general</span> <span m="200790">purpose way of putting things together so as to build a</span> <span m="205970">structure or architecture in which particular intelligent</span> <span m="209530">systems could be built.</span> </p>
<p><span m="213400">So their idea was called the general problem solver.</span> </p>
<p><span m="225210">A long name for a simple idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="229630">And the simple idea is that you start your life out in a</span> <span m="232890">current state, call it C. And you want to get</span> <span m="237640">to some goal state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="239710">Call it S. And a way you do that is you measure somehow</span> <span m="243940">the symbolic difference between where you are and</span> <span m="246810">where you want to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="248610">So that's the difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="250085">We'll call that difference D. And when you observe that</span> <span m="254370">difference that's enough, they say, in this general approach</span> <span m="259200">to problem solving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="260339">For you to select some operation that will move you</span> <span m="263970">from your current state to some new state, an</span> <span m="266880">intermediate state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="267880">Call it I. So I, or that operator, O, is determined by</span> <span m="275500">the difference, D.</span> </p>
<p><span m="277659">And then, of course, the next thing to do is to measure the</span> <span m="280520">difference between that intermediate state and the</span> <span m="283350">state you want to be in, and choose some operator that's</span> <span m="287300">relevant to reducing that state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="289440">So we'll call that D2, and we'll call this O2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="293490">And D2 is what leads you to 02, and so it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="298950">So that's the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="300550">And that's often called means-ends analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="303470">Why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="303620">Because the end that you want to achieve is being in that</span> <span m="307620">final state, S. And the means is that operator, O. So you</span> <span m="313430">have some notion of where you want to be and the difference</span> <span m="315450">of where you are and where you want to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="317060">And you pick an operator so as to reduce that difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="320570">So this is all very abstract.</span> </p>
<p><span m="322700">Let's exercise it in solving a problem that you will all be</span> <span m="327020">faced with here in a day or two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="328930">That is, for many of you--</span> <span m="330910">most Of you, I hope-- the problem of going home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334210">So here you are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="336050">You're at MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="338450">And where you want to be is over here, at home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="344860">So you measure the difference between MIT and home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="349180">And for many of you it's further than you can go by car</span> <span m="351990">and not so far that you can't go at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="354070">So what you do is, you say, well, the right operator is</span> <span m="357180">taking an airplane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="359620">So there is the operator, take an airplane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="369090">And this is the difference, D. And the difference, D, being</span> <span m="373600">sufficiently large, you take the plane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="377630">Trouble is, if you happen to be sitting here in</span> <span m="380260">[? 10-250 ?]</span> <span m="381420">there's no way you can take an airplane, because they don't</span> <span m="383490">fit in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="385460">So you've got another problem, and that is</span> <span m="387040">to get to the airplane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="389330">So the distance between here and Logan is such that the</span> <span m="392560">right way to do that is to take the MBTA.</span> </p>
<p><span m="400980">And that's determined because you're working on this</span> <span m="403310">difference reduction right here, the difference from</span> <span m="405840">being at MIT and being at the airport.</span> </p>
<p><span m="408070">So that difference dictates that you take the MBTA.</span> </p>
<p><span m="410610">So you see, you're re-cursing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="413909">But you know there are no MBTA cars in here either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416860">So there's still a difference like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="420210">And that difference dictates that you walk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="425310">So you've got D1, D2, and D3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="430670">And by the time you've excised the operators relevant to</span> <span m="434140">those three differences, you're at Logan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="436690">Then you take the airplane, you get over to your hometown,</span> <span m="439705">and your faced with the smaller difference of getting</span> <span m="442960">from that airport to where you actually want to go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="445660">So that's the general problem- solver idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="449150">It was such an exciting idea at the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="454440">It was such an exciting idea at the time because people</span> <span m="456850">would say to themselves, ah!</span> </p>
<p><span m="459380">This is a general purpose problem solver, so we can set</span> <span m="462570">it onto the problem of making itself smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="466740">And so there was a kind of imagined chain reaction that</span> <span m="469460">would take place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="471080">And the developers of this architecture warned the public</span> <span m="475659">that within 10 years-- that is to say, by about 1970--</span> <span m="479190">computers would be generally as smart as people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483760">And a lot of people made fun of them for that prediction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485870">But it was actually scientists attempting to be responsible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="489300">Because they thought something, a quite serious</span> <span m="492750">dislocation was coming along, and that people should know</span> <span m="495220">that it was coming.</span> </p>
<p><span m="496400">And so they felt it was their responsibility in that age of</span> <span m="499030">scientific responsibility to warn the public.</span> </p>
<p><span m="502810">It didn't turn out that way, because the problem of</span> <span m="508770">collecting the differences and finding the operators, that's</span> <span m="512049">outside the scope of the architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="514340">So this is the problem that has to be solved by a human</span> <span m="518500">before this architecture can be used.</span> </p>
<p><span m="520570">You have to have identified the differences that you might</span> <span m="524370">encounter and the operators that you might use, and build</span> <span m="531490">this table which relates the two together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="534740">So maybe that one, that one, some off-diagonal</span> <span m="537150">elements, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="538490">But building that table turned out to be a hard job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="542600">So not surprisingly, the idea evolved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="545210">And eventually the folks at Carnegie who developed the</span> <span m="548940">general problem solver--</span> <span m="550790">most notably Newell and his students--</span> <span m="554170">developed a newer, fresher, more elaborate architecture</span> <span m="557800">called SOAR.</span> </p>
<p><span m="563610">And here's how SOAR works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="564760">First of all, what does SOAR mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="571860">It doesn't mean anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="573090">It used to mean State Operator And Result.</span> </p>
<p><span m="589660">But for some reason the proponents of the SOAR</span> <span m="592360">architecture decided they don't like that acronym, and</span> <span m="595450">have asserted that SOAR is merely a label that shouldn't</span> <span m="599540">be thought of as an acronym.</span> </p>
<p><span m="602010">In any event, SOAR consists of various parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="605940">It has a long-term memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610750">It has a short-term memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="616050">And it has connections to the outside world, maybe a vision</span> <span m="621030">system and an action system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="624950">But most of the activity of the SOAR problem-solving</span> <span m="629380">architecture takes place in a short-term memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="633750">So you can view the contents of the long-term memory as</span> <span m="636300">shuttling in and out of short-term memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="638000">So you can see right away that this mechanism, this</span> <span m="640950">architecture, is heavily influenced by certain</span> <span m="645800">cognitive psychology experiments having to do with</span> <span m="649060">how much you can hold in your short-term memory--</span> <span m="651400">nonsense syllables and all that sort of thing that was</span> <span m="653530">popular back in those days.</span> </p>
<p><span m="656570">So this was an architecture devised primarily by</span> <span m="659530">psychologists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660380">And it had amongst its features a short-term memory</span> <span m="664170">and a long-term memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="668330">So that's part 1 of this architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="670580">So what's in the long-term memory?</span> </p>
<p><span m="672770">Well, assertions and rules, AKA productions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="690830">A production being the Carnegie vernacular for rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="695390">It's just the rule-based stuff like you saw on almost the</span> <span m="698060">first day of class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="699930">So the whole thing is a gigantic rule-based system</span> <span m="703650">with assertions and rules the shuttle back and forth from</span> <span m="708230">long-term memory into short-term memory where</span> <span m="710160">processing takes place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712740">The third thing that comes to mind when you think of SOAR</span> <span m="715350">architecture is they had an elaborate preference system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="724530">You recall that when we talked about rule-based systems</span> <span m="726610">there's always a question of what do you do when more than</span> <span m="728560">one rule would work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="730300">You have to have some way of breaking those ties.</span> </p>
<p><span m="733300">The SOAR architecture has an elaborate</span> <span m="735430">subsystem for doing that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738770">But I said that these are the first three things you think,</span> <span m="740580">and maybe that's not right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="741760">Because the next thing you think about is perhaps a</span> <span m="745050">better thing to identify with the SOAR architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="749890">And that's the idea of problem spaces.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758620">And that's the idea that if you're going to solve a</span> <span m="760160">problem you have to develop a space and do a search through</span> <span m="764220">that space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="765760">Just like we did when we talked about how we can get</span> <span m="768280">from here to home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="770580">There's a space of places, that's our problem space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774310">We can do a search through that space to find a way to</span> <span m="776430">get from one place to another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="778400">That's the sort of thing that SOAR is focused on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="783540">Finally, the fifth element that you tend to think about</span> <span m="787520">when you think about SOAR is the idea of universal</span> <span m="791150">subgoaling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801440">And that's the idea that whenever you can't think of</span> <span m="803540">want to do next, that becomes your next problem that</span> <span m="807420">deserves it's own problem space and its own set of</span> <span m="810590">differences and operators, and rules and assertions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815210">So you start off on a high level, then you have to solve</span> <span m="817970">problems at a lower level, just like you did up there</span> <span m="820560">with a general problem solver.</span> </p>
<p><span m="823430">So if you have these two architectures you can begin to</span> <span m="826090">say, well, what are they centered on?</span> </p>
<p><span m="829280">And this architecture, this general problem solver, is</span> <span m="833860">centered on the idea that everything is</span> <span m="835970">about problem solving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="840150">Because the problem solving hypothesis--</span> <span m="849630">no one gave it that name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="851020">But that's what it was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852680">And this architecture did get its name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="854770">And it was said always, by Newell, to be based on what he</span> <span m="860860">called the symbol system hypothesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="873660">The hypothesis that what we are as humans is symbol</span> <span m="876760">manipulators.</span> </p>
<p><span m="878100">And we can uncover how that all works by giving people</span> <span m="883980">crypto-arithmetic problems and having them talk out loud, by</span> <span m="887960">thinking about what happens when you try to remember</span> <span m="889850">nonsense syllables, by all that sort of stuff that was en</span> <span m="893280">vogue in terms of psychology experiments in the day when</span> <span m="897120">this architecture was first articulated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="900110">But when you look at architectures you can sort of</span> <span m="901700">see where they come from and what their antecedents are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905472">It has a short-term memory and a long-term memory, because</span> <span m="912290">Newell and his associates were cognitive scientists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="915730">It has assertions and rules and preferences, because</span> <span m="921140">Newell and his associates were also AI people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="925170">And it has problem spaces and universal subgoaling because</span> <span m="929950">those are ideas that had been work out in a more primitive</span> <span m="932520">form already in the general problem-solver architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="937370">So that's a glimpse of what SOAR looked like</span> <span m="939740">in its early days.</span> </p>
<p><span m="940750">It's been very highly developed by a</span> <span m="942350">lot of smart people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="944280">So although it's symbol centered, they've attached to</span> <span m="947420">it things having to do with emotion and perception, but</span> <span m="950710">generally with the view that the first thing to do when</span> <span m="953290">faced with this perception is to get it out of there and get</span> <span m="957020">it into a symbolic form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="958830">That's sort of the bias that the architecture comes with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="965180">So those are two architectures that are heavily biased toward</span> <span m="969770">thinking that the important part of what we</span> <span m="971570">do is problem solving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="974600">But the most important, perhaps--</span> <span m="977020">at least from an MIT perspective--</span> <span m="978820">of these problem-solving oriented ways of thinking</span> <span m="981770">about the world, is Marvin Minsky's architecture, which</span> <span m="986150">he articulates in his book "The Emotion Machine."</span> <span m="996860">And Marvin is not just concerned with problem</span> <span m="999820">solving, but also with how problem solving</span> <span m="1002080">might come in layers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1003620">So let me show you an example of the sort of problem what</span> <span m="1006960">motivates some of Marvin's thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016770">So you can read that, it's a short little vignette.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1034387">You have no trouble understanding it, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037708">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1039098">It's not difficult for us humans.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1040960">Awfully tough for a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042950">In part, because the thinking you need, your ability to</span> <span m="1047760">understand that story, requires you to think on many</span> <span m="1051210">levels at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1054110">First of all, there's a sort of, at the</span> <span m="1057030">bottom, instinctive reaction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066950">You see where there's instinctive reaction?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1068650">That's the part where she hears a sound</span> <span m="1073000">and terns her head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1073850">That's instinct, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1074400">That's practically built in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077190">But then what she sees is a car.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1079030">So that's something that we don't have wired in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1082310">It would be unlikely that we've evolved in the last 100</span> <span m="1085700">years to have an instinctive appreciation of cars</span> <span m="1088500">barrelling down the road.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1089980">So the next level in Marvin's</span> <span m="1091120">architecture is learned reaction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1102000">So that's the part about thinking about the car.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105530">Now spread throughout there-- well, let's see where is a</span> <span m="1108320">particularly good example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1111640">She decides to sprint across the road.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1114750">So that's where she's solving a problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1117380">So that's the deliberative thinking level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127770">It doesn't stop there, because later on she reflects on her</span> <span m="1135630">impulsive decision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1137670">So she thinks not only about stuff that's happening out</span> <span m="1139950">there in the world, but she also thinks about stuff that's</span> <span m="1143020">going on in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1144970">So that's a level which we can call reflective thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1156340">Well, you know, it doesn't stop there, because she also</span> <span m="1160630">considers, in another part of the story, something about</span> <span m="1164690">being uneasy about arriving late.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1167690">So she's not only just thinking about events that are</span> <span m="1169790">going on in her mind right now, but events that are going</span> <span m="1172890">on right now relative to plans she's made.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176610">Some Marvin calls that the self-reflecting layer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1188820">But that isn't the whole thing either, because toward the end</span> <span m="1192280">of the story she starts to worry about what her friends</span> <span m="1194560">would think of her.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1195970">So there's a kind of reflective thinking in a more</span> <span m="1198580">social context.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1200410">So he calls that self-conscious thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1211280">So as the Carnegie folks think, the SOAR architecture</span> <span m="1215270">focuses mostly on problem solving, Minsky's "Emotion</span> <span m="1219830">Machine" book considers not just thinking, but thinking on</span> <span m="1225980">many layers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1228700">And the blocker to doing any of that can be said to be the</span> <span m="1234740">development of common sense, which computers, alas, have</span> <span m="1238700">never had much of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1240430">So this could be said to be based on the common sense</span> <span m="1247170">hypothesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1253180">And the common sense hypothesis holds that in order</span> <span m="1255530">to do all of that stuff, you have to have</span> <span m="1257590">common sense like people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1259650">And if you have to have common sense like people, you have to</span> <span m="1261420">think about how much of that is there and how</span> <span m="1264700">can we go get it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266460">And so this spawned a lot of activity in the media lab</span> <span m="1273390">amongst people influenced by Marvin, having to do with</span> <span m="1275680">gathering common sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1277340">The open mind project, the work of Henry Lieberman and</span> <span m="1280420">others, having to do with the gathering of common sense from</span> <span m="1284260">the world wide web as a way of populating systems that would</span> <span m="1289330">lay the foundation for doing this kind of layered thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1296130">So that is a brief survey of some mechanisms, some older</span> <span m="1303290">than others, but all but GPS--</span> <span m="1307210">GPS too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1308070">Let's face it, it's hard to think of solving any problem</span> <span m="1310630">without means-ends analysis being involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1312020">So GPS isn't wrong, it's just not the only tool you need to</span> <span m="1317380">think about what to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1319430">So these are early, and late, and still-current.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1323950">But it's not the only thing there is, because there have</span> <span m="1327260">been reactions against this problem-solving way of</span> <span m="1329850">thinking about the development of intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1332740">And the most prominent of those counter currents, of</span> <span m="1336120">those alternative ideas, belongs to Rod Brooks and his</span> <span m="1339900">subsumption architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1342130">So along about the early--</span> <span m="1344950">along about the years surrounding 1990, Brooks</span> <span m="1350100">became upset--</span> <span m="1353750">subsumption--</span> <span m="1359190">because robots couldn't do much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1361610">They would turn them on at night, and then the next</span> <span m="1363980">morning they'd come in the laboratory and they would have</span> <span m="1365750">moved 25 feet, nicely avoiding a table perhaps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1371820">Not doing very much and taking a long time to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1375500">So he had decided that it's because people were thinking</span> <span m="1378070">in the wrong way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380590">In those days people thought that the way you build a robot</span> <span m="1384770">is you build a vision system, and then you build a reasoning</span> <span m="1387970">system, and then you build an action system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391340">And it can do almost nothing, but it does something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395830">So you improve the vision system, and improve the</span> <span m="1398980">reasoning system, and improve the actual system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402530">And now you've broken it, because all the stuff you used</span> <span m="1405090">to be able to do doesn't work anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1409000">So what's the alternative?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410490">Well, the alternative, as articulated by Brooks, is to</span> <span m="1413320">turn this idea on its side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415900">So instead of having an encapsulated vision system, an</span> <span m="1420570">encapsulated reasoning system, and an encapsulated action</span> <span m="1422960">system, what you have is layers that are focused not on</span> <span m="1427390">the sensing and the reasoning and the action, but layers</span> <span m="1430820">that are specialized to dealing with the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1435260">So in Brook's way of thinking about things, at the lowest</span> <span m="1439000">level you might have a system that's capable of--</span> <span m="1441880">well, before we get to that, avoiding objects.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1446580">And maybe the next level up is the wandering layer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1451460">And maybe the next level up after that is explore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1457990">And maybe the next level up after that is seek.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1464060">Now in the old days when people took 6001 I had no</span> <span m="1466550">trouble getting an answer the question, what does this</span> <span m="1469930">remind you of in 6001?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472940">It doesn't remind you of anything in 6001 since you</span> <span m="1474530">haven't taken it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475740">But it viewed, as a generalization of a</span> <span m="1478780">programming idea, what is the programming idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1482620">There are only a few powerful ideas in program, and this is</span> <span m="1485740">a generalization of one of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1488180">What is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489070">Do you have a name?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1490400">Yes, Andrew?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1491412">STUDENT: Layers of abstraction?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1492620">PROFESSOR: Layers of abstraction,</span> <span m="1494210">and abstraction barriers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1496760">That nails it pretty well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1498500">Because each of these guys can have its own vision, action,</span> <span m="1503690">and reasoning system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509980">And if you think of these as abstraction boundaries, then</span> <span m="1512870">when you got this thing working you don't screw with</span> <span m="1515035">it anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516460">You build this layer on top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518020">And it may reach down in here from time to time, but it</span> <span m="1520240">doesn't fundamentally change it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1522990">Brooks was inspired in part by the way our brains are</span> <span m="1525790">constructed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526980">All that old stuff that we share with pigs is down in</span> <span m="1529340">there deep, and we put the neocortex over it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532090">So it looks layered in a way that would make</span> <span m="1534660">[? Gerry Sussman ?] proud.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1536960">So this then is the way that Brooks looks at the world, and</span> <span m="1542610">it's characterized by a few features just like SOAR is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1547310">One of those features is no representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1558740">So this is a detail that's probably right at the level</span> <span m="1563920">that Brooks was operating, and very questionable when you get</span> <span m="1567620">above the level that Brooks was operating.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570310">But before I go on, let me say what the hypothesis is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1575810">The hypothesis is the creature hypothesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1585550">It's the hypothesis that once you can get a machine to act</span> <span m="1590320">as smart as an insect, then the rest will be easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1595960">Well, how do you get a creature to</span> <span m="1596930">be smart as an insect?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1598200">Maybe you don't need representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1599760">We focused on representation in this course, so you can see</span> <span m="1602330">there's a little stress---</span> <span m="1610680">Next thing is, what do you do if you don't have a</span> <span m="1612210">representation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1614490">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1615110">Your representation makes a model possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1617430">Models make it possible to predict, to understand, to</span> <span m="1622250">explain, and to control.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1623780">So if you don't have one what can you possibly do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1626630">Brooks' answer is, you use the world instead of a model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641500">So everything you do is reactive.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643790">You don't have anything in your head that is</span> <span m="1645210">a map of this room.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1647990">But maybe I don't need one because I can get around that</span> <span m="1650930">table by constantly observing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1653720">And we don't have to fill up the memory with that</span> <span m="1655200">information, I can just react to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1660560">So no representation, use the world instead of a model, and</span> <span m="1666010">the mechanisms in their purest form are just</span> <span m="1670630">finite-state machines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1679350">So with that, Brooks was able to do things that people were</span> <span m="1682940">never able to do before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1686350">And what's the modern [? instantiation ?]</span> <span m="1688330">of this architecture?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690390">Now, according to Brooks, in use in 5 million homes in the</span> <span m="1694010">United States?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1698009">STUDENT: The Roomba?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1698950">PROFESSOR: It's the Roomba The Roomba robot is, by Brooks'</span> <span m="1703900">account, approximately the thirteenth</span> <span m="1705850">business plan of iRobot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1707960">And it's the one that made it big, because the Rumba vacuum</span> <span m="1712740">cleaner has been very successful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1715610">Would you like to see a movie of its processor?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1720960">So this is a film made some time ago that shows, in some</span> <span m="1725520">sense, the summa of that architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1729370">What I want you to imagine very briefly is a robot that</span> <span m="1733300">wanders around in the halls and rooms of the old</span> <span m="1737600">[? Tech Square ?]</span> <span m="1738290">clinking the Coke cans.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1741440">Okay, you all got an image of that in your mind?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1744920">Because I want you to compare the image you now have of that</span> <span m="1747260">robot that's wandering around collecting the Coke can, with</span> <span m="1750550">the actual movie.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1761693">[VIDEO PLAYBACK]</span> <span m="1762180">-Herbert, the soda-can collecting mobile robot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1765520">He was built at the MIT AI lab in 1989.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1769360">Work was done by John Cannell under the supervision of</span> <span m="1772606">Rodney Brooks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1774820">Herbert is a robot controlled by subsumption architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1778800">This is a collection of small behaviors that influence the</span> <span m="1783700">overall activities of the robot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1785920">There are no centralized controllers</span> <span m="1788310">and no world model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1791380">-Herbert navigates by using a number of infrared proximity</span> <span m="1795890">censors around its body and basically</span> <span m="1798610">following walls and corridors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1801350">It can also look for the can through a laser light striper.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1804710">Right now it's come out of the door of an office, followed</span> <span m="1807370">along the wall, and then its laser light striper has seen a</span> <span m="1812350">can on top of the desk in front of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815400">When this happens the robots and deploys its arm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820060">You can see the arm going out now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824180">-The arm has a number of censors itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1826470">There are fingertip censors, a break beam in the jaws, and</span> <span m="1830130">two infrared proximity sensors on the front of the hand.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834340">-It grabs cans in a stereotype fashion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1836960">First, it lowers down to find a surface somewhere, then it</span> <span m="1840720">bounces along the surface until it</span> <span m="1842630">sees the can in front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1844630">It uses the hand-based IRs to re-center the arm by rotating</span> <span m="1848495">the robot's body until the can comes between the jaws of the</span> <span m="1852380">gripper, at which point the break-beam senses the can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1857960">-After acquiring the can, Herbert will have tucked the</span> <span m="1860050">arm back into its normal traveling configuration and</span> <span m="1863371">attempt to go home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1873740">-Since it has no central [? arm presentation, ?] it</span> <span m="1875560">doesn't have any map of where it came from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1877400">Instead, it has an algorithm which uses a magnetic compass</span> <span m="1881550">to determine every time it comes through a door, will it</span> <span m="1885000">be able to find the door?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1886290">It basically has a policy of always going north every time</span> <span m="1889770">it exits the door.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1893220">-So now the can is being tucked away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1896280">As the robot turns you'll see a red stripe from the laser</span> <span m="1899040">range finder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1906240">And now it's using the [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1907410">IR to navigate back, find the door, and go through the door</span> <span m="1911530">with its prize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1927616">[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]</span> <span m="1928120">PROFESSOR: And there, if you were paying attention, you saw</span> <span m="1929700">a little glimpse of John Cannell who was the student to</span> <span m="1932840">develop that system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1933700">So that was a tour de force.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936950">That was a magic moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1938070">That was when you open the champagne.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1939970">It's not what you expected, of course, because when I say</span> <span m="1942430">imagine a robot wandering around in [? Tech Square ?]</span> <span m="1945280">picking up Coke cans, that leaves open a huge envelope of</span> <span m="1948160">possible hallucinations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1950120">And usually or hallucinations about these things are--</span> <span m="1953930">we imagine things to be more fluid, more natural, and more</span> <span m="1958590">impressive than they actually are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1959780">But that was impressive, because no robot came close to</span> <span m="1963680">doing anything like that before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969030">More to be said about that during the</span> <span m="1970740">business lecture on Wednesday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1976000">So that's the subsumption architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1978810">By the way, maybe at this point we can say something</span> <span m="1986230">about how the other architectures relate to what</span> <span m="1990020">Minsky was talking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1992460">What's this deliberative thinking layer correspond to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1998270">That's what SOAR is about, and maybe GPS.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2007020">So what's subsumption about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010200">It's about stuff down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018400">It's about instinctive reaction and learned reaction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2035290">But shoot, what about Minsky's other layers?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2039120">If we're going to be building systems that are as smart as</span> <span m="2042180">those things then we have to worry a little bit about that</span> <span m="2044390">sort of thing too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2045710">So that brings us to the genesis architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2049080">And now let me give you the standard caution that should</span> <span m="2052679">be early in the presentation of any academic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055500">I will sometimes say "I," and what I mean is "we." And</span> <span m="2059940">sometimes I'll say "we," and what I mean is "they." This</span> <span m="2063540">was a system that was developed mostly by students</span> <span m="2067739">of mine who persuaded me, after a great deal of time,</span> <span m="2071280">that they were thinking the right kinds of thoughts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2074420">But here's how the genesis architecture works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2078469">As no surprise, given recent discussions, it's all centered</span> <span m="2083940">on language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2090429">And the language part of the genesis system has two roles,</span> <span m="2094880">one of which is to guide, and marshal, and interact with the</span> <span m="2099910">perceptual systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107230">And the other is to enable the description of events.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2136980">That's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2137610">So is perception important?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2141372">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143290">I might ask you a question like, is there anybody sitting</span> <span m="2147130">in the front row wearing blue jeans?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150440">And it's hard for you to resist, under those</span> <span m="2152410">circumstances, your eyes from going over there and answering</span> <span m="2155370">the question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2156350">Your eyes answer the question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2158180">No symbol processing system is involved, except in so far as</span> <span m="2162780">my language system has communicated with their</span> <span m="2165600">language system, which drives your motor system and your</span> <span m="2168540">vision system to go over there and answer the</span> <span m="2170690">question for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2173490">But it's not just the real stuff that the language system</span> <span m="2176980">directs your attention to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178040">It's also the imagined stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180970">It's been a long semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2182160">Have I told you the story about my table saw?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2185010">Probably not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2185580">Here's the deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2186120">I bought a table saw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2187630">It's a wonderful table saw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189560">I was installing it with a friend of mine</span> <span m="2190940">who's a cabinet maker.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2193190">He said, never wear gloves when you operate the saw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2197910">"Why?" I said.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199950">Before he could answer the question I figured it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201900">Can you figure out why you never wear gloves when you</span> <span m="2203540">operate a table saw?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2205450">You know what a table saw is, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2206930">It's a table with a spinning blade in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2208650">And you use it to cut wood.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2211640">Why should you never wear gloves?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215095">Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215582">STUDENT: Well--</span> <span m="2216560">STUDENT: --Well, you know the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2217770">Ha, that's not fair.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219170">That's old Brett up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220230">He's heard the story too many times.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2223180">Yes, Andrew, you got it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225042">STUDENT: I've been told the answer before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2226810">PROFESSOR: You've been told the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2227960">How about somebody who hasn't been told the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2229740">Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230130">STUDENT: Because the gloves might get caught.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2231920">PROFESSOR: Because the glove might get caught and pull your</span> <span m="2234410">hand into the blade.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2235670">And then what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239140">It's horrible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239740">You're hand gets mangled and your fingers get cut off, and</span> <span m="2243360">this happens a lot to professionals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2246300">It won't actually happen with that table saw that I bought,</span> <span m="2248790">because its play detects flesh and stops the blade, which</span> <span m="2253130">then leads to stopping the blade and having the blade</span> <span m="2255250">retreat into the table in about two microseconds--</span> <span m="2258140">two milliseconds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2259590">So, in general though, it's a bad idea, and you always have</span> <span m="2262460">to suppose that the mechanism isn't working anyway in order</span> <span m="2266490">to use good safety practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2268320">But here's an example of something that nobody ever</span> <span m="2270170">told you that he was able to figure out, by imagining what</span> <span m="2273560">would happen and reading the answers off of the scene that</span> <span m="2276815">he imagined.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2278420">So nobody ever says many of the things that we know, but</span> <span m="2282260">we know them anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2283000">Here's another example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284330">Imagine running down the street with a</span> <span m="2285650">full bucket of water.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2286550">What happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2289190">The water splashes out and gets your leg wet, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2292110">You won't find that in Open Minds database.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2294500">Nobody ever said that over the web.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2296630">It's not written down anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297620">But you know it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2299040">Because you, we human beings have the capacity to imagine</span> <span m="2302710">perceptual things and read the answers to questions off of</span> <span m="2307090">our imaginations with that perceptual apparatus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2310940">So that's a very important connection down there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2315020">And then if you've got the ability to describe events,</span> <span m="2318150">then you've got the ability to tell and understand stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2325180">And if you can do that, then you can start to get a handle</span> <span m="2328030">on culture, both macro and micro.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2338790">And by macro culture I mean the country you grew up in,</span> <span m="2344500">the religion you grew up with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346320">And by micro I mean your family and personal</span> <span m="2349290">experience, and all shades in between.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354570">So I don't know, what inspires me and my associates to think</span> <span m="2358520">in these terms?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2359250">We talked about a little bit of it last time when I talked</span> <span m="2361800">about evolution and the apparent flowering of our</span> <span m="2367060">species about 50,000 years ago, at</span> <span m="2370140">which time we got something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2372300">And I believe that what we got--</span> <span m="2374940">and this is the characterization of this</span> <span m="2377260">particular hypothesis--</span> <span m="2380540">what we got is the ability to tell stories</span> <span m="2385130">and understand them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386980">So if we want to label this representation, it's the label</span> <span m="2392540">strong story hypothesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2402200">So what's the weak story hypothesis?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2403530">The weak story hypothesis is, this is important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2406540">The strong story hypothesis is, this is all there is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2411260">But is there any other evidence of this is really,</span> <span m="2414190">really, really important?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415670">So I've queried Krishna here before the class starts, and</span> <span m="2420520">he tells me I haven't told you about the following</span> <span m="2423560">experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424850">This, in my way of thinking, is the most important series</span> <span m="2428300">of experiments ever done in cognitive psychology,</span> <span m="2432720">developmental psychology, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435550">So here's how we get started.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2443380">There's a rectangular room, if you're a person.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2448070">If you're a rat, it's a rectangular box.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2451490">All the walls are painted white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2453720">Are you with me so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2455610">So now, in each corner there's a basket, or cloth, or</span> <span m="2462360">something in which or under which you can put some food.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470320">Now, you put the food there while the rat watches you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2478550">And then you give the rat a little spin to disorient it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2486540">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2488790">So then, the rest stops and goes for the food.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494130">And you can keep track of where the rat goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2497440">And the rat goes with approximate equal probability</span> <span m="2501070">predominantly to those two corners.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2504760">So I'd have bet you didn't know that</span> <span m="2506096">rats were that smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2508040">So they understand the rectangular nature of the room</span> <span m="2511070">and they don't go to the diagonal corners where the</span> <span m="2512880">food cannot be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2515090">So are these genius rats?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2518390">Or maybe we're just rats with big brains.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2520050">Because we do the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2522550">So if you repeat this experiment and replace the rat</span> <span m="2528220">with a small child, and then you put a toy in there instead</span> <span m="2534470">of food, and the rat--</span> <span m="2537520">not the rat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2538550">The child is usually held in a parent's arms, usually the</span> <span m="2544600">child's mother--</span> <span m="2546780">usually because they think that if they participate in</span> <span m="2548840">these experiments up there at Harvard their kid will get</span> <span m="2551320">into Harvard some day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2554290">So the kid goes to a diagonal corner just like a rat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2559860">And then the next thing you do is, you try an adult, maybe an</span> <span m="2566790">MIT student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568890">That way you can use food again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2575650">And you get the same result.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2578330">Who could be surprised?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2580680">So rats, children, and human adults, pretty much all the</span> <span m="2584570">same with respect to this experiment, until you paint</span> <span m="2591450">one wall blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2593440">Rats are not colorblind, in case you're wondering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2596370">Then what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2599130">Well, if you pay one wall blue the rat still goes with equal</span> <span m="2605930">probability to the two diagonal corners.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2609560">If you paint one wall blue, the child still goes to the</span> <span m="2613370">two diagonal corners with approximate equal probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617230">It's only us genius human adults who go</span> <span m="2622940">only to that corner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2626870">So this invites a couple of questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2631690">One of which is, when does a child become an adult?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2637510">Any ideas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2640990">[INAUDIBLE], what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2644185">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2646610">PROFESSOR: You can pick a number greater than 1</span> <span m="2648630">and less than 10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2654620">[INAUDIBLE], what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2656024">STUDENT: Five?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2656860">PROFESSOR: It's a pretty good guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2659550">Do you have siblings at that age?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661920">It's a surprise but, why is it five?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2663980">Is it because--</span> <span m="2665480">what does it relate to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666910">Is there any correlate to the onset of that ability?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670450">You might try everything, as [INAUDIBLE] does, because</span> <span m="2672450">she's extremely careful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675250">So she's tried gender, she's tried the onset of language,</span> <span m="2680340">the appreciation of music, handedness, and there's only</span> <span m="2684430">one thing that matters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686530">And that is that the child becomes adult at that time</span> <span m="2691640">when they start to use the word left and right when they</span> <span m="2694440">describe the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2697450">Now I said that very carefully because they understand left</span> <span m="2699700">and right at an earlier age, but they only have started to</span> <span m="2703050">use the words left and right when they describe the world</span> <span m="2705530">at the time that they begin to break this symmetry and go to</span> <span m="2710900">the correct corner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2713560">Now for the next element of this I need something to read.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2716140">Has anyone got a textbook handy?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722720">Ah, "China, an Illustrated History."</span> <span m="2727680">Now I need a volunteer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2730875">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2731320">Andrew, you want to do this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2732440">So here's what you're going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2737080">You can stay there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2738270">But you need to stand up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2740520">So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to read you a</span> <span m="2742750">passage from this book.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2744310">And I want you to say it back to me at the</span> <span m="2745710">same time I read it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2747260">It's as if you're doing simultaneous translation,</span> <span m="2751610">except it's English to English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2756970">This things got words I can't pronounce.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2759160">OK, are you ready to go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761080">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2762220">"When overwhelmed by the magnitude of the problems he</span> <span m="2765330">tackled, he began to suspect that others were plotting</span> <span m="2768730">against him or secretly ridiculing him."</span> <span m="2774600">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2775420">That's great.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2776560">So you see, he could do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2777880">Some people can't do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2778880">At least it take a little practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2781360">But he did it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782780">And guess what I've done to him?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2785080">I've reduced his intelligence to that of a rat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2789080">Because if you do this experiment with an adult human</span> <span m="2796930">who's doing this simultaneous English to English</span> <span m="2798850">translation, they go with equal</span> <span m="2800940">probability to the two corners.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2803910">So what's happened?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2805210">What's happened is you've jambed</span> <span m="2807720">their language processor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2810930">And when their language processor is jambed they can't</span> <span m="2814070">put the blue wall together with the rectangular shape.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2817970">So it seems to be that language is the mediator of</span> <span m="2820290">exactly the combinators you need in order to build</span> <span m="2822520">descriptions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2824250">Because they can't even put those things together when</span> <span m="2826870">their language processor is jambed by the simultaneous</span> <span m="2829870">translation phenomenon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2833670">So that brings us to the two gold star ideas of the day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837310">One is, if you want to make yourself smarter you want to</span> <span m="2849730">do those things--</span> <span m="2850690">look, listen, draw, and talk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2852760">Because those are the particular mechanisms that</span> <span m="2856100">surround this area down here, which is the center of what we</span> <span m="2860440">do-- which is the center of our thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2863120">So why do you take notes in class?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2865140">Now because you'll ever look at them before, but because it</span> <span m="2867350">forces the engagement of your linguistic--</span> <span m="2871980">of your linguistic, your motor,</span> <span m="2873390">and your visual apparatus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2874820">And that makes you smarter, because it's</span> <span m="2876520">exercising that stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2879520">The second thing you can say, in conclusion, especially from</span> <span m="2882560">this experiment, is beware of fast talkers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2896820">Why do you want to be aware of fast talkers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2899260">It's not because they will talk you into anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2902430">It's because that when they talk fast they're jambing your</span> <span m="2904940">language processor and you can't thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2908000">That's why you want to be aware of fast talkers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2912600">Because if they jamb your language processor you won't</span> <span m="2914850">thinking and you'll buy that car, or you'll buy that drink,</span> <span m="2918200">or you'll do any manner of things that people who want</span> <span m="2920925">you to do those things have learned to do by talking to</span> <span m="2925272">jamb your processor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2927960">So that completes what we're going to do today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929620">And I'll give you a demonstration of some of this</span> <span m="2931290">stuff on another occasion.</span> </p>

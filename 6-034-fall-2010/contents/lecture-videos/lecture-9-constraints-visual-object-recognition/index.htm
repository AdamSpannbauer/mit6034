<p><strong>Description:</strong> We consider how object recognition has evolved over the past 30 years. In alignment theory, 2-D projections are used to determine whether an additional picture is of the same object.

<p><span m="9215">PATRICK WINSTON: You know, it's unfortunate that politics</span> <span m="11320">has become so serious.</span></p>
<p><span m="14730">Back when you were little it was a lot more fun.</span></p>
<p><span m="17360">You could make fun of politicians.</span></p>
<p><span m="20740">Here's a politician some of you may recognize.</span></p>
<p><span m="27480">But it's convenient to be able to vary what this particular</span> <span m="31970">politician looks like.</span></p>
<p><span m="34210">For example, we can go from a cookie baker to radical.</span></p>
<p><span m="41274">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="43960">PATRICK WINSTON: We can go from superwoman to bimbo.</span></p>
<p><span m="51544">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="54030">PATRICK WINSTON: Socialite--</span> <span m="55920">I put socialite into this.</span></p>
<p><span m="59710">There she is.</span></p>
<p><span m="62340">Or we can move the slider over the other way to bag lady.</span></p>
<p><span m="68430">Alert, asleep, sad, happy.</span></p>
<p><span m="74550">How does that work?</span></p>
<p><span m="78830">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span m="79340">But I bet by the end of this hour you'll</span> <span m="80950">know how that works.</span></p>
<p><span m="82360">And not only that, you'll understand something about</span> <span m="85690">what it takes to recognize faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="89940">It turns out to some theories of face recognition are based</span> <span m="94380">on the same principles that this program is based on.</span></p>
<p><span m="101791">But you can kind of guess what's happening here.</span></p>
<p><span m="105030">There are many stored images and when I move those sliders</span> <span m="109500">it's interpolating amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span m="112590">So that's how that works.</span></p>
<p><span m="116270">But the main subject of today is this matter</span> <span m="120500">of recognizing objects.</span></p>
<p><span m="122390">Faces could be the objects, but they don't have to be.</span></p>
<p><span m="124620">This could be an object that you might want to recognize.</span></p>
<p><span m="128430">And I want to talk to you a little bit about the history</span> <span m="131580">of this problem and where it stands today.</span></p>
<p><span m="133930">It's still not solved.</span></p>
<p><span m="135900">But it's an interesting exercise to see how the</span> <span m="138760">attempts at solution have evolved slowly</span> <span m="142360">over the past 30 years.</span></p>
<p><span m="143940">So slowly, in fact, that I think if someone told me how</span> <span m="148160">long it would take to get to where we are 30 years ago I</span> <span m="151380">think I would have hung myself.</span></p>
<p><span m="153579">But things do move slowly.</span></p>
<p><span m="156440">And it's important to see how slowly they move.</span></p>
<p><span m="158500">Because they will continue to move slowly in the future.</span></p>
<p><span m="162170">And you have to understand that that's the way things</span> <span m="163920">work sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span m="165990">So to start this all off, we have to go back to the ideas</span> <span m="169590">of the legendary David Marr, who dropped dead from leukemia</span> <span m="173060">in about 1980.</span></p>
<p><span m="176250">I say, the gospel according to Marr, because he was such a</span> <span m="180700">powerful and central figure that almost anything he said</span> <span m="183960">was believed by a large collection of devotees.</span></p>
<p><span m="189800">But Marr articulated a set of ideas about how computer</span> <span m="195240">vision would work that started off by suggesting that with</span> <span m="199810">the input from the camera, you look for edges.</span></p>
<p><span m="206340">And you find edge fragments.</span></p>
<p><span m="207700">And normally they wouldn't be even as well-drawn as I've</span> <span m="215720">done them now.</span></p>
<p><span m="217990">Or as badly drawn as I've done them now.</span></p>
<p><span m="220410">But the first step, then, in visual recognition would be to</span> <span m="223460">form this edge-based description of what's out</span> <span m="226329">there in the world.</span></p>
<p><span m="227720">And Marr called that the primal sketch.</span></p>
<p><span m="237620">And from the primal sketch, the next step was to decorate</span> <span m="240960">the primal sketch with some vectors, some surface normals,</span> <span m="246600">showing where the faces on the object were oriented.</span></p>
<p><span m="252440">He called that the two and a half D sketch.</span></p>
<p><span m="261360">Now why is it two and a half D?</span></p>
<p><span m="262620">Well, it's sort of 2D in the sense that it's still</span> <span m="266360">camera-centric in its way of presenting information.</span></p>
<p><span m="271070">But at same time, it attempts to say something about the</span> <span m="273360">three-dimensional arrangement of the faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="277110">So the speculation was that you couldn't get to where you</span> <span m="279610">wanted to go in one step.</span></p>
<p><span m="281330">So you needed several steps to get from the image to</span> <span m="283970">something you could recognize.</span></p>
<p><span m="285990">And the third step was to convert the two and a half D</span> <span m="290100">sketch into generalized cylinders.</span></p>
<p><span m="303100">And the idea is this.</span></p>
<p><span m="303960">If you have a regular cylinder, you can think of it</span> <span m="308140">as a circular area moving along an axis like so.</span></p>
<p><span m="313650">So that's the description of a cylinder.</span></p>
<p><span m="316570">A circular area moving along an axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="318990">You can get a different kind of cylinder if you go along</span> <span m="323010">the same axis but you allow the size of the circle to</span> <span m="326320">change as you go.</span></p>
<p><span m="327820">So for example, if you were to describe a wine bottle.</span></p>
<p><span m="335550">It would be a function of distance along the axis that</span> <span m="337590">would shrink the circle appropriately to match the</span> <span m="342580">dimensions of a wine bottle.</span></p>
<p><span m="345520">A fine burgundy, I perceive.</span></p>
<p><span m="346780">In any case, this one once converted into a generalized</span> <span m="350920">cylinder, when matched against a library of such</span> <span m="354260">descriptions, results in recognition.</span></p>
<p><span m="364290">Great theory, based on the idea that you start off by</span> <span m="367190">looking at edges and you end up, in several steps of</span> <span m="371330">transformation, producing something that you could look</span> <span m="374470">up in a library of descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span m="377350">Great idea.</span></p>
<p><span m="380100">Trouble is, no one could make it work.</span></p>
<p><span m="386950">It was too hard to do this.</span></p>
<p><span m="388976">It was too hard to do that.</span></p>
<p><span m="391250">And the generalized cylinders produced, if</span> <span m="392980">any, were too coarse.</span></p>
<p><span m="395980">You couldn't tell the difference between a Ford and</span> <span m="397520">a Chevrolet or between a Volkswagen and a Cadillac.</span></p>
<p><span m="400520">Because they were just too coarse.</span></p>
<p><span m="403010">So although it was a great idea based on the idea that</span> <span m="405655">you have to do recognition in several transformations of</span> <span m="409580">representational apparatus, it just didn't work.</span></p>
<p><span m="415430">So much later, maybe 15 years later or so, we get to the</span> <span m="420880">next part of our story.</span></p>
<p><span m="422610">Which is the alignment theories, most notably the one</span> <span m="427590">produced by Shimon Ullman, one of Marr's students.</span></p>
<p><span m="432580">So the alignment theory of recognition is based on a very</span> <span m="436810">strange and exotic idea.</span></p>
<p><span m="439250">It doesn't seem strange and exotic to mechanical engineers</span> <span m="442930">for a while, because they're used to mechanical drawings.</span></p>
<p><span m="445470">But here's the strange and miraculous idea.</span></p>
<p><span m="448620">Imagine this object.</span></p>
<p><span m="450110">You take three pictures of it.</span></p>
<p><span m="453540">You can reconstruct any view of that object.</span></p>
<p><span m="458390">Now, I have to be a little bit careful about how I say that.</span></p>
<p><span m="461860">First of all, some of the vertexes are not visible in</span> <span m="466960">the views that you have.</span></p>
<p><span m="468490">So, of course, you can't do anything with those.</span></p>
<p><span m="470880">So let's say that we have a transparent object where you</span> <span m="473600">can see all the vertexes.</span></p>
<p><span m="475570">If you have three pictures of that, you can reconstruct any</span> <span m="479840">view of that object.</span></p>
<p><span m="481990">Now I have to be a little careful about how I say that,</span> <span m="484090">because it's not true.</span></p>
<p><span m="486430">What's true is, you can produce any view of that in</span> <span m="489730">orthographic projection.</span></p>
<p><span m="491620">So if you're close enough to the object that you get</span> <span m="493670">perspective, it doesn't work.</span></p>
<p><span m="495010">But for the most part, you can neglect perspective after you</span> <span m="498420">get about two and a half times as far away as</span> <span m="500860">the object is big.</span></p>
<p><span m="502420">And you can presume that you've got orthographic</span> <span m="504830">projection.</span></p>
<p><span m="507560">So that's a strange and exotic idea.</span></p>
<p><span m="509500">But how can you make a recognition</span> <span m="511080">theory out of that?</span></p>
<p><span m="512150">So let me show you.</span></p>
<p><span m="513740">Well, here's one drawing of the object, I need two more.</span></p>
<p><span m="519230">Let's see.</span></p>
<p><span m="520020">Let's have this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="528440">And maybe one that's tilted up a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span m="538140">It's important that these pictures not be just rotations</span> <span m="545360">on one axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="546030">Because they wouldn't form what you might think of as a</span> <span m="547860">kind of basis set.</span></p>
<p><span m="549870">So there are three pictures.</span></p>
<p><span m="550850">We'll call them a, b, and c.</span></p>
<p><span m="555830">And then we want a fourth picture.</span></p>
<p><span m="558860">Which will look like this.</span></p>
<p><span m="561172">It doesn't have to be too precise.</span></p>
<p><span m="564570">And we'll call that the unknown.</span></p>
<p><span m="566890">And what we really want to know is if the unknown is the</span> <span m="573220">same object that these three pictures were made from.</span></p>
<p><span m="581170">So let me begin with an assertion.</span></p>
<p><span m="584230">I'll need four colors of chalk to make this assertion.</span></p>
<p><span m="587570">What I want to do is I want to pick a particular place on the</span> <span m="591310">object, like this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="595770">And maybe the same place on this object over here.</span></p>
<p><span m="598220">Those are corresponding places, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="600790">So I can now write an equation that the x-coordinate of that</span> <span m="605480">unknown object is equal to, oh, I don't know, alpha x sub</span> <span m="612690">a plus beta x sub b plus gamma x sub c plus</span> <span m="624620">some constant, tau.</span></p>
<p><span m="627460">Well, of course, that's obviously true.</span></p>
<p><span m="629010">Because I'm letting you take those alpha, beta, gamma, and</span> <span m="632330">tau and make them anything you want.</span></p>
<p><span m="636680">So although that's conspicuously obviously true,</span> <span m="639870">it's not interesting.</span></p>
<p><span m="641630">So let me take another point.</span></p>
<p><span m="645410">And of course, I can write the same equation down for this</span> <span m="648680">purple point.</span></p>
<p><span m="661800">And now that I'm on a roll and having a great deal of fun</span> <span m="665190">with this, I can take this point</span> <span m="672760">and make a blue equation.</span></p>
<p><span m="686110">And you know I'm destined to do it, so I've</span> <span m="689840">got one more color.</span></p>
<p><span m="691050">I might as well use it.</span></p>
<p><span m="692872">Let's just make sure I get something that works here.</span></p>
<p><span m="696350">That's this one, that's this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="698810">I hope I've got these correspondences right.</span></p>
<p><span m="702180">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="702700">PATRICK WINSTON: Have I got one off?</span></p>
<p><span m="704030">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="705190">PATRICK WINSTON: Which color?</span></p>
<p><span m="705865">STUDENT: Blue.</span></p>
<p><span m="706210">[INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="707570">PATRICK WINSTON: OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="707930">So this one goes with this one, goes with this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="711500">Is that one wrong?</span></p>
<p><span m="712200">STUDENTS: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span m="714920">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, oh, oh.</span></p>
<p><span m="716100">Of course this one, excuse me, goes down here.</span></p>
<p><span m="720442">Right?</span></p>
<p><span m="722380">And then this one is off as well.</span></p>
<p><span m="725520">I wouldn't get a very good recognition scheme if I can't</span> <span m="727870">get those correspondences right.</span></p>
<p><span m="730630">Which is one of the lessons of today.</span></p>
<p><span m="736108">OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="736550">Now I've got them right.</span></p>
<p><span m="737820">And now that equation is correct.</span></p>
<p><span m="739700">I think I've got this one right already.</span></p>
<p><span m="742970">So now I can just write that down.</span></p>
<p><span m="744730">I'm on a roll, I'm just copying this.</span></p>
<p><span m="757870">So those are a bunch of equations.</span></p>
<p><span m="761460">And now the astonishing part is that I can choose alpha,</span> <span m="769530">beta, gamma, and tau to be all the same.</span></p>
<p><span m="779710">That is, there's one set of alpha, beta, gamma, and tau</span> <span m="783200">that works for everything, for all four points.</span></p>
<p><span m="787220">So you look at that puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span m="789330">And that's OK to be puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span m="790450">Because I certainly haven't proved it.</span></p>
<p><span m="791890">I'm asserting it.</span></p>
<p><span m="794430">But right away, there's something interesting about</span> <span m="795890">this and that is that the relationship between the</span> <span m="798330">points on the unknown object and the points in this stored</span> <span m="802020">library of images are related linearly.</span></p>
<p><span m="808700">That's true because it's orthographic projection.</span></p>
<p><span m="811570">Linearly related.</span></p>
<p><span m="812880">So I can generate the points in some fourth object from the</span> <span m="818610">points in three sample objects with linear operations.</span></p>
<p><span m="823740">Christopher?</span></p>
<p><span m="823990">STUDENT: Is that the x-coordinate of--</span> <span m="826950">PATRICK WINSTON: It's the x-coordinate.</span></p>
<p><span m="830840">Christopher asked about the x-coordinates.</span></p>
<p><span m="832380">Each of these x-coordinates are meant to be color coded.</span></p>
<p><span m="835850">It gets a little complicated with notation and stuff.</span></p>
<p><span m="840130">So that's the reason I'm color coding the coordinates.</span></p>
<p><span m="843720">So the orange x sub u is the x-coordinate of that</span> <span m="849710">particular point.</span></p>
<p><span m="850570">STUDENT: In 3D space?</span></p>
<p><span m="852390">PATRICK WINSTON: No.</span></p>
<p><span m="853610">Not in 3D space.</span></p>
<p><span m="854480">In the image.</span></p>
<p><span m="855536">STUDENT: So it's a 2D projection of it?</span></p>
<p><span m="857720">PATRICK WINSTON: It's a 2D projection of it, an</span> <span m="859750">orthographic projection.</span></p>
<p><span m="860600">OK?</span></p>
<p><span m="861450">So we're looking at drawings.</span></p>
<p><span m="864010">And those coordinates over there are the two-dimensional</span> <span m="866500">coordinates in the drawing.</span></p>
<p><span m="869470">Just as if it were on your retina.</span></p>
<p><span m="872615">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="874555">vertexes on the 3D projection or can curved surfaces also?</span></p>
<p><span m="879410">PATRICK WINSTON: So he asked about curved surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span m="881470">And the answer is that you have to find corresponding</span> <span m="883810">points on the object.</span></p>
<p><span m="885610">So if you have a totally curved surface and you can't</span> <span m="890070">identify any corresponding points, you lose.</span></p>
<p><span m="892940">But if you consider our faces, there are some obvious points,</span> <span m="896230">even though our face are not by any means</span> <span m="898700">flat like these objects.</span></p>
<p><span m="900970">We have the tip of our nose and the center of our</span> <span m="903260">eyeballs and so on.</span></p>
<p><span m="906290">So if that's true, what does that mean about recovering</span> <span m="911250">alpha, beta, gamma, and tau?</span></p>
<p><span m="915390">Can we find them?</span></p>
<p><span m="918590">[INAUDIBLE], what do you think?</span></p>
<p><span m="919890">How do we go about finding them?</span></p>
<p><span m="921300">You're nodding your head in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span m="922920">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="923880">STUDENT: It's four equations and--</span> <span m="926280">PATRICK WINSTON: Splendid.</span></p>
<p><span m="926550">It's four equations and four unknowns.</span></p>
<p><span m="928712">Four linear equations and four unknowns.</span></p>
<p><span m="930400">So obviously, you can solve for alpha, beta, gamma, and</span> <span m="933560">tau if you know that these equations are correct.</span></p>
<p><span m="937960">So how does that help us with recognition?</span></p>
<p><span m="941390">It helps us with recognition because we can take another</span> <span m="944000">point, let me say this square point here and this</span> <span m="951820">corresponding square point here and this corresponding</span> <span m="958410">square point here, and what can we do with those three</span> <span m="960750">points now?</span></p>
<p><span m="962460">We've got alpha, beta, gamma, and tau, so we can predict</span> <span m="965610">where it's going to be in the fourth image.</span></p>
<p><span m="969060">So we can predict that that square point is going to be</span> <span m="975310">right there.</span></p>
<p><span m="977060">And if it isn't, we're highly suspicious about whether this</span> <span m="981030">object is the kind of object we think it is.</span></p>
<p><span m="985230">So you look at me in disbelief.</span></p>
<p><span m="986480">You'd like me to demonstrate this, I imagine.</span></p>
<p><span m="989036">STUDENT: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span m="989472">PATRICK WINSTON: OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="991220">Let me see if I can demonstrate this.</span></p>
<p><span m="1011480">So I'm going to do this in a slightly simplified version.</span></p>
<p><span m="1017110">I'm only going to allow rotation around</span> <span m="1021320">the vertical axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="1023270">And just so you know I'm not cheating, there's a little</span> <span m="1025680">slider here that rotates that third object.</span></p>
<p><span m="1029358">Let's see, why are there just two known</span> <span m="1032770">objects and one unknown?</span></p>
<p><span m="1033940">Well that's because I've restricted the motion to</span> <span m="1036740">rotation around the vertical axis and some translation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1040848">So now that I've spun that around a little bit, let me</span> <span m="1044630">pick some corresponding points.</span></p>
<p><span m="1047300">Oops.</span></p>
<p><span m="1048508">What's happened?</span></p>
<p><span m="1061240">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span m="1061520">Let me run that by again.</span></p>
<p><span m="1084430">OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="1084780">So there's one point I've selected</span> <span m="1087060">from the model objects.</span></p>
<p><span m="1088970">The corresponding point over here on the</span> <span m="1090830">unknown is right there.</span></p>
<p><span m="1092400">I'm going to be a little off.</span></p>
<p><span m="1093350">But that's OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="1095120">So let me just pick that one and then that</span> <span m="1098480">corresponds to this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="1100650">Krishna, would you like to specify a point so people know</span> <span m="1103870">I'm not cheating.</span></p>
<p><span m="1105680">Pick a point.</span></p>
<p><span m="1107900">Pick a point, Krishna.</span></p>
<p><span m="1109050">STUDENT: Oh, the right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1110874">PATRICK WINSTON: The right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1112020">STUDENT: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span m="1112700">PATRICK WINSTON: This one?</span></p>
<p><span m="1113190">STUDENT: Yep.</span></p>
<p><span m="1115046">PATRICK WINSTON: Oops.</span></p>
<p><span m="1115510">OK, let's pick it out on the model first.</span></p>
<p><span m="1117310">Now pick it over here.</span></p>
<p><span m="1120175">Boom.</span></p>
<p><span m="1120670">So all the points are where they're supposed to be.</span></p>
<p><span m="1123290">Isn't that cool?</span></p>
<p><span m="1125690">Well, let's suppose that the unknown is something else.</span></p>
<p><span m="1130540">This is a carefully selected object.</span></p>
<p><span m="1132710">Because the points are all the correct positions vertically,</span> <span m="1137320">but they're not necessarily the correct positions in the</span> <span m="1139300">other two dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span m="1140950">So let me pick this point, and this point, and this point,</span> <span m="1148830">and this point.</span></p>
<p><span m="1151160">And Krishna had me pick this point.</span></p>
<p><span m="1154630">So let me pick this point.</span></p>
<p><span m="1157220">So if it thinks that the unknown is one of these</span> <span m="1161530">obelisk objects, then we would expect to see all of the</span> <span m="1165420">corresponding points correctly identified.</span></p>
<p><span m="1168280">But boom.</span></p>
<p><span m="1169780">All the points are off.</span></p>
<p><span m="1174850">So it seems to work in this particular example.</span></p>
<p><span m="1177360">I find the alpha and beta using two images.</span></p>
<p><span m="1183640">And I predict the locations of the other points.</span></p>
<p><span m="1187010">And I determine whether those positions are correct.</span></p>
<p><span m="1189630">And if they are correct, then I have a pretty good idea that</span> <span m="1191780">I have in fact identified the object on the right as either</span> <span m="1194840">an obelisk or an organ, depending on which of the</span> <span m="1199540">model choices and the unknown choices I've selected.</span></p>
<p><span m="1205420">So the only thing I have left to do is to demonstrate that</span> <span m="1209550">what I said about this is true.</span></p>
<p><span m="1212160">So I'm going to actually demonstrate that what I said</span> <span m="1214880">about this is true using the configuration in this</span> <span m="1218710">demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span m="1219640">Because it's much too hard for me to remember matrix</span> <span m="1223120">transformations for generalized rotation in three</span> <span m="1225930">dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span m="1227600">So here's how it's going to work.</span></p>
<p><span m="1233410">The z-axis is going up that way.</span></p>
<p><span m="1237140">Or, it's going to be pointing toward you.</span></p>
<p><span m="1241640">And what I'm going to do is I'm going to</span> <span m="1243760">rotate around this axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="1246820">And what I want to do is I want to find out how the</span> <span m="1249750">x-coordinate in the image of the points move</span> <span m="1252670">as I do that rotation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1256350">So here's the x-axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="1260300">This is the coordinate that you can see.</span></p>
<p><span m="1263180">Here is the y-axis.</span></p>
<p><span m="1265520">That's in depth, so you can't tell how far away it is.</span></p>
<p><span m="1270750">And the z-axis--</span> <span m="1272180">x, y, z-axis must be pointing out that way toward you.</span></p>
<p><span m="1277060">So now I'm going to consider just a single point on the</span> <span m="1281660">object and see what happens to it.</span></p>
<p><span m="1284310">So I'm going to say to myself, let's put the object in some</span> <span m="1291640">kind of standard position.</span></p>
<p><span m="1292650">I don't care what it is.</span></p>
<p><span m="1294300">It can be just random, just spin it around.</span></p>
<p><span m="1296450">Some position, we'll call that the standard position, S. And</span> <span m="1302810">that means that the x-coordinate of the standard</span> <span m="1306770">position is x sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1309890">And the y-coordinate of the standard position is y sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1317520">And now I'm going to rotate the object three times.</span></p>
<p><span m="1321930">Once to form the a picture, once to form the b picture,</span> <span m="1325280">and once to form the c picture.</span></p>
<p><span m="1327110">And you can make those choices.</span></p>
<p><span m="1329960">Those can be anything, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1332330">So let's say that the a picture is out here.</span></p>
<p><span m="1338540">So that's the a picture.</span></p>
<p><span m="1342190">The B picture is out here.</span></p>
<p><span m="1345040">And the unknown is up that way.</span></p>
<p><span m="1352000">And so what I want to know depends on these vectors.</span></p>
<p><span m="1357540">We'll call that theta sub a, and this is theta sub b.</span></p>
<p><span m="1365230">And this one is theta sub u.</span></p>
<p><span m="1370430">So I would like to know how x sub a depends on x</span> <span m="1381950">sub s and y sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1385490">And I can never remember how to do that, because I can</span> <span m="1388490">never remember the transformation</span> <span m="1389810">equations for rotation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1391480">So I have to figure it out every time.</span></p>
<p><span m="1394880">And this is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span m="1396090">So what I'm going to say is that this vector that goes out</span> <span m="1398870">to S consists of two pieces.</span></p>
<p><span m="1401900">There's the x part and the y part.</span></p>
<p><span m="1405570">And I know that I can rotate this vector by alpha sub a by</span> <span m="1410390">rotating this vector and rotating that vector and</span> <span m="1413130">adding up the results.</span></p>
<p><span m="1415370">So if I rotate this vector by alpha sub a, then the</span> <span m="1419930">contribution of that to the x-coordinate of a is going to</span> <span m="1426200">be given by the cosine of theta sub a</span> <span m="1432790">multiplied by x sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1436530">So you can just exaggerate that motion, say, well if I</span> <span m="1439360">pitch it up that way then the projection down on the x-axis</span> <span m="1443220">is going to be this length of the vector times the</span> <span m="1446520">cosine of the angle.</span></p>
<p><span m="1450410">Now there's also going to be a dependence on y sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1455930">Let's figure out what that's going to be.</span></p>
<p><span m="1457820">I've got this vector here.</span></p>
<p><span m="1459065">And I'm going to rotate it by theta sub a as well.</span></p>
<p><span m="1462220">If I rotate that by theta sub a and see what the projection</span> <span m="1465250">is on the x-axis, that's going to be given by</span> <span m="1468020">the sine of the angle.</span></p>
<p><span m="1470570">But it's going the wrong way, so I have to subtract it off.</span></p>
<p><span m="1474080">So that's how I don't have to remember what the signs are on</span> <span m="1476825">these equations.</span></p>
<p><span m="1484520">Well, that was good.</span></p>
<p><span m="1485450">And now that I'm off and running I can</span> <span m="1487940">do what I did before.</span></p>
<p><span m="1488710">It makes it easy to give the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span m="1490280">Because this is going to be x sub b is equal to x sub s</span> <span m="1494120">times the cosine of theta sub b minus y sub s times the</span> <span m="1500690">cosine of theta--</span> <span m="1503240">oh, you're letting me make mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span m="1505690">Shame.</span></p>
<p><span m="1509740">I can generally tell by all the troubled looks.</span></p>
<p><span m="1512050">But there should be some shouting as well.</span></p>
<p><span m="1514280">That's the sine and that's the sine.</span></p>
<p><span m="1518150">And one more time.</span></p>
<p><span m="1519780">x sub u is equal to x sub s times the cosine of theta sub</span> <span m="1526890">u minus y sub s times the sine of theta sub u.</span></p>
<p><span m="1533830">And I forgot the b up there.</span></p>
<p><span m="1536670">So there are some equations.</span></p>
<p><span m="1537880">And we don't know what we're doing.</span></p>
<p><span m="1539710">We're just going to stare at them awhile and see if they</span> <span m="1541610">sing us a song.</span></p>
<p><span m="1545200">So let's see if they sing us a song.</span></p>
<p><span m="1548480">What about x sub a and x sub b?</span></p>
<p><span m="1554350">These are things that we see in the image.</span></p>
<p><span m="1557160">These are things that we can measure.</span></p>
<p><span m="1570850">What about all those cosines and sines of theta</span> <span m="1574100">a's and theta b's.</span></p>
<p><span m="1576000">Well, we have no idea what they are.</span></p>
<p><span m="1578010">But one thing is clear.</span></p>
<p><span m="1580420">They're true for all of the points on the object.</span></p>
<p><span m="1585260">Because when we rotate the object around by angle theta,</span> <span m="1588740">we're rotating all of the points through</span> <span m="1591510">the same angle, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1593790">So with respect to any</span> <span m="1595250">particular view of the object--</span> <span m="1598790">here we are in the standard position.</span></p>
<p><span m="1601810">Here we are in position a.</span></p>
<p><span m="1604590">The vectors to all of the points on the object are</span> <span m="1606830">rotated by the same angle when we go from the standard</span> <span m="1610510">position to the a position.</span></p>
<p><span m="1613240">So that means that for all of the images in this particular</span> <span m="1622100">rendering, with a particular rotation by theta a, theta b,</span> <span m="1626940">and theta u, those are constants.</span></p>
<p><span m="1635820">Now remember this is for a particular theta a, a</span> <span m="1638125">particular theta be, and a particular theta u.</span></p>
<p><span m="1641140">As long as we're talking about all of the points for each of</span> <span m="1643850">those rotations, those angles and cosines are going to be</span> <span m="1648920">the same for all possible points on the object.</span></p>
<p><span m="1657780">OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="1658110">So now we go back to our high school algebra experts and we</span> <span m="1661790">say, look at these first two equations, We've got two</span> <span m="1669880">equations and what we can now construe to be two unknowns.</span></p>
<p><span m="1675540">What are the unknowns that are left?</span></p>
<p><span m="1677210">We can measure a and b.</span></p>
<p><span m="1678990">Whatever the cosines are, they're the</span> <span m="1680700">same for all the pictures.</span></p>
<p><span m="1682660">So if we treat those as constants, then we can solve</span> <span m="1685580">for x sub s and y sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1688770">Right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1690490">We can solve for x sub s and y sub s in terms of x sub a and</span> <span m="1694860">x sub b and a whole bunch of constants.</span></p>
<p><span m="1700190">But, I don't know, a whole bunch of constants, let's see.</span></p>
<p><span m="1707220">We can gather up all of those cosines and ratios of sines</span> <span m="1710640">and cosines and all that stuff and put them all together.</span></p>
<p><span m="1714350">Because they're all constants.</span></p>
<p><span m="1716130">And then we can do this.</span></p>
<p><span m="1718320">We can say x sub u is equal to--</span> <span m="1728060">well, it's going to depend on x sub a and x sub b.</span></p>
<p><span m="1734010">And by the time we wash or manipulate or screw around</span> <span m="1738030">with all those cosines, we can say that the multiplier for x</span> <span m="1743220">sub a is some constant alpha and the multiplier for x sub b</span> <span m="1747670">is some constant beta.</span></p>
<p><span m="1749910">So that's not a slight of hand.</span></p>
<p><span m="1751500">That's just linear</span> <span m="1752710">manipulation of those equations.</span></p>
<p><span m="1755300">And that's what we wanted to show, that for orthographic</span> <span m="1757940">projection, which this is-- there is no perspective</span> <span m="1761130">involved here, we're just taking the projection along</span> <span m="1763530">the x-axis--</span> <span m="1766480">we can demonstrate for this simplified situation that that</span> <span m="1770060">equation must hold.</span></p>
<p><span m="1773880">Now I want to give you a few puzzles.</span></p>
<p><span m="1775310">Because this stuff is so simple.</span></p>
<p><span m="1776730">Suppose I allow translation as well as rotation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1781020">What's going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span m="1782696">STUDENT: You just get the tau.</span></p>
<p><span m="1784094">Basically, you get a constant.</span></p>
<p><span m="1784560">PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, you add a constant, tau.</span></p>
<p><span m="1786180">But what do we need to do in order to solve it?</span></p>
<p><span m="1787760">STUDENT: Subtract them [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="1789221">You subtract two equations and then [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="1792630">PATRICK WINSTON: Let's see, now we've got</span> <span m="1794950">three unknowns, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="1796206">I don't know tau.</span></p>
<p><span m="1796985">I don't know x sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1798216">And I don't know y sub s.</span></p>
<p><span m="1800910">So I need another equation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1802650">Where do I get the other equation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1804534">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="1805430">PATRICK WINSTON: From another picture.</span></p>
<p><span m="1809910">That's why up there I needed four points.</span></p>
<p><span m="1814150">That covers a situation where I've got three degrees of</span> <span m="1817690">rotation and translation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1820080">Here I got by with just two pictures in this illustration.</span></p>
<p><span m="1825360">That one involved a tau translational element, so I</span> <span m="1827840">needed three pictures.</span></p>
<p><span m="1828720">And this one's got full rotation, so I needed four.</span></p>
<p><span m="1832700">So great idea, works fine.</span></p>
<p><span m="1840226">The trouble is it doesn't work so fine on natural objects.</span></p>
<p><span m="1845410">It works fine on things that are manufactured because they</span> <span m="1848630">all have identical dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span m="1851250">So if I made a million of these in a factory, I'd have</span> <span m="1855420">no trouble recognizing them.</span></p>
<p><span m="1856950">Because all I'd have to do is take three pictures, record</span> <span m="1862090">the coordinates of some of the points, and I'd be done.</span></p>
<p><span m="1864840">The trouble is the natural world isn't like this.</span></p>
<p><span m="1870410">And you aren't like this either.</span></p>
<p><span m="1876100">I don't know, if I'm trying to recognize faces, it's not that</span> <span m="1881020">easy to do all this.</span></p>
<p><span m="1883700">First of all, it's a little difficult to find the exact</span> <span m="1887380">point, the exactly corresponding points.</span></p>
<p><span m="1890390">I made a mistake in doing it myself.</span></p>
<p><span m="1892950">And if the computer made a mistake it would certainly</span> <span m="1895230">make an error.</span></p>
<p><span m="1896060">Because it would be using non-corresponding points to</span> <span m="1899440">make the prediction.</span></p>
<p><span m="1900120">So it would be way off.</span></p>
<p><span m="1902656">But this is still in the tradition of working from</span> <span m="1907070">local features in the objects toward recognition.</span></p>
<p><span m="1911950">So having looked at that theory, we also find it a</span> <span m="1918790">little wanting.</span></p>
<p><span m="1919350">It works great it some circumstances, doesn't seem to</span> <span m="1922280">solve the whole recognition problem.</span></p>
<p><span m="1927190">Years pass.</span></p>
<p><span m="1929590">Shimon Ullman comes up with another theory that's not so</span> <span m="1933600">much based on edge fragments or the location of particular</span> <span m="1940310">features but rather on correlation.</span></p>
<p><span m="1947570">Taking a picture of, say, Krishna's face, taking a</span> <span m="1952930">picture of the whole class, and then using that as a kind</span> <span m="1957120">of correlation mask, running it all over the picture of the</span> <span m="1960680">class, seeing where it maximizes out.</span></p>
<p><span m="1963050">Now that's vague.</span></p>
<p><span m="1963600">I'll explain when I'm talking about [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1965480">correlation in a minute.</span></p>
<p><span m="1967610">But it's basically saying, if I have a picture of Krishna,</span> <span m="1973400">where do I find him?</span></p>
<p><span m="1974390">I'll find him in one place.</span></p>
<p><span m="1975902">But you know what?</span></p>
<p><span m="1977750">Krishna doesn't look like anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span m="1980410">So I might not find any other faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="1982810">And if my objective is to find all the faces, then maybe that</span> <span m="1986840">idea won't work either.</span></p>
<p><span m="1989150">Or, to take another example, here's a dollar bill.</span></p>
<p><span m="1993590">We haven't had raises in quite well, so this is my last one.</span></p>
<p><span m="1998130">It's got a picture of George Washington on it.</span></p>
<p><span m="2000950">And I can look all over the class.</span></p>
<p><span m="2002740">And if I use this is as a face detector, I'd be sorely</span> <span m="2006630">disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span m="2007100">Because I wouldn't find any faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="2009430">Because thank God, nobody looks exactly like George</span> <span m="2012350">Washington.</span></p>
<p><span m="2012890">So the correlation wouldn't work very well.</span></p>
<p><span m="2016700">So that idea's a loser.</span></p>
<p><span m="2021580">But wait a minute.</span></p>
<p><span m="2022290">I don't have to look for the whole face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2025250">I could just look for eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2030790">And then I could look for noses and maybe mouths.</span></p>
<p><span m="2033770">And maybe I could have a library of 10 different eyes</span> <span m="2037080">and 10 different noses and 10 different mouths.</span></p>
<p><span m="2041280">Would that idea work?</span></p>
<p><span m="2046100">Probably not so well.</span></p>
<p><span m="2047440">The trouble with that one is, I'd find</span> <span m="2049420">eyeballs in every doorknob.</span></p>
<p><span m="2051676">There's just not enough stuff there to give me a reliable</span> <span m="2057960">correlation.</span></p>
<p><span m="2060920">So let's make this a little more concrete by</span> <span m="2063989">drawing some pictures.</span></p>
<p><span m="2069770">Halloween is approaching.</span></p>
<p><span m="2072880">So here's a face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2082387">All right?</span></p>
<p><span m="2084375">Here's another face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2095840">So those might be faces in my pre-recorded library of</span> <span m="2099160">pumpkin faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="2101410">Now along comes this face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2113690">What's going to happen?</span></p>
<p><span m="2116270">Well, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span m="2118490">Let's draw yet another face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2132020">I don't know, that could be a pretty weird</span> <span m="2133440">pumpkin face, I suppose.</span></p>
<p><span m="2134460">But I mean it to be something that doesn't look very much</span> <span m="2137000">like a face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2139460">So if I'm doing a complete correlation with either of</span> <span m="2144380">these faces in my library, neither one will match this</span> <span m="2147280">one very well.</span></p>
<p><span m="2151150">If I'm looking for fine features like eyes, then I've</span> <span m="2155800">got these eyes everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span m="2161300">So it doesn't help very much.</span></p>
<p><span m="2164190">So you can see where I'm going.</span></p>
<p><span m="2165380">And you can reinvent Ullman's great idea.</span></p>
<p><span m="2170030">What is it?</span></p>
<p><span m="2171960">We don't look for big features, like whole faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="2175200">We don't look for small features,</span> <span m="2176970">like individual eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2178846">We look for intermediate features, like two eyes and a</span> <span m="2182180">nose, or a mouth and a nose.</span></p>
<p><span m="2185040">So when we do that, then we can say, now, here are two</span> <span m="2194310">eyes and a nose.</span></p>
<p><span m="2197120">Well, that's found in this one.</span></p>
<p><span m="2202370">And what about the combination of that nose and that mouth?</span></p>
<p><span m="2208460">Oh, that's over here.</span></p>
<p><span m="2211051">But neither of those features can be found</span> <span m="2213030">in the fourth image.</span></p>
<p><span m="2216800">So that's the Goldilocks principle.</span></p>
<p><span m="2219410">When you're doing this sort of thing, you want things that</span> <span m="2220945">are not too small and not too big.</span></p>
<p><span m="2223500">I've got the Rumpelstiltskin principle up</span> <span m="2227740">there, too, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span m="2228970">Because I meant to mention that Marr was a genius at</span> <span m="2232020">naming things.</span></p>
<p><span m="2233830">And even though many of his theories have faded, he's</span> <span m="2238650">still known for these names like primal sketch and two and</span> <span m="2241520">a half D sketch because he was such an artist</span> <span m="2243030">at naming the concepts.</span></p>
<p><span m="2244610">He even got credit for a lot of stuff that he didn't do.</span></p>
<p><span m="2247900">Not because he was deliberately trying to get it</span> <span m="2253440">inappropriately, but just because he was so good at</span> <span m="2255240">naming stuff.</span></p>
<p><span m="2256490">So we had the Rumpelstiltskin principle back then.</span></p>
<p><span m="2258450">And now we have the Goldilocks principle.</span></p>
<p><span m="2260050">Not too big, not too small.</span></p>
<p><span m="2263535">But that leaves us with the final question, which is, so</span> <span m="2268150">if what we want to do is look for intermediate-size</span> <span m="2271230">features, how do we actually find them in a sea</span> <span m="2274410">of faces out there?</span></p>
<p><span m="2275770">See, I might have a library, I might take 10 of you and</span> <span m="2278400">record your eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2281050">Take another ten, record your mouths.</span></p>
<p><span m="2283530">And they may be put together in a unique way for each of</span> <span m="2286400">you out there.</span></p>
<p><span m="2286870">But it's likely that I'll fin Lana's eyes</span> <span m="2290390">somewhere else in a crowd.</span></p>
<p><span m="2292430">And Nicola's mouth somewhere else in a crowd.</span></p>
<p><span m="2296850">So how do we in fact go about finding them?</span></p>
<p><span m="2301330">And I mentioned the term correlation a</span> <span m="2303080">couple of times now.</span></p>
<p><span m="2304720">Let me make that concrete.</span></p>
<p><span m="2311270">So let's consider a one-dimensional face that</span> <span m="2318790">looks like this.</span></p>
<p><span m="2327950">Which is a signal.</span></p>
<p><span m="2330810">And I'm going to consider a one-dimensional image.</span></p>
<p><span m="2336160">And in that one-dimensional image I've got a</span> <span m="2344390">facsimile of the face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2346670">And the question is, what kind of algorithm could I use to</span> <span m="2348850">determine the offset in the image where the face occurs?</span></p>
<p><span m="2354030">So you can see that one possibility is you just do an</span> <span m="2357320">integral of the signal in the face and the signal out here</span> <span m="2365270">over the extent of the face and see how it multiplies out.</span></p>
<p><span m="2369610">Or, to make it less lawyerly and more MITish, let's say</span> <span m="2374920">that what we're going to do is we're going to maximize over</span> <span m="2381310">some parameter x the integral over x of some face, which is</span> <span m="2392190">a function of x and the image g, which is a function of x</span> <span m="2404220">minus that offset.</span></p>
<p><span m="2407830">So when the offset, t, is equal to this offset, then</span> <span m="2414200">we're essentially multiplying the thing by itself and</span> <span m="2417350">integrating over the extent of the face.</span></p>
<p><span m="2419890">And that gives you a very big number if they're lined up and</span> <span m="2424610">a very small number if they're not.</span></p>
<p><span m="2427420">And it's even true if we add a whole lot of</span> <span m="2432370">noise to the images.</span></p>
<p><span m="2437130">But these are images.</span></p>
<p><span m="2438660">They're not one dimensional.</span></p>
<p><span m="2439595">But that's OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="2441210">It's easy enough to make a modification here.</span></p>
<p><span m="2444215">We're going to maximize over translation</span> <span m="2446980">parameters x and y.</span></p>
<p><span m="2449140">And these are no longer functions of just x, they're</span> <span m="2451970">also functions of y.</span></p>
<p><span m="2456900">Like so.</span></p>
<p><span m="2459750">So that's basically how it works.</span></p>
<p><span m="2461380">We won't go into details about normalization and all that</span> <span m="2463690">sort of thing because that's the stuff of which other</span> <span m="2466480">courses remain the custodians.</span></p>
<p><span m="2471340">So would you like to see a demonstration?</span></p>
<p><span m="2473412">OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="2496410">All right.</span></p>
<p><span m="2497220">So without realizing it, Nicola and Erica have loaned</span> <span m="2502000">us their pictures.</span></p>
<p><span m="2504080">And they are embedded in that big field of noise.</span></p>
<p><span m="2509490">And it's pretty easy to pick out Erica and Nicola, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="2512170">Because we are actually pretty good at picking faces out of</span> <span m="2517120">these images.</span></p>
<p><span m="2518740">So let's add some noise.</span></p>
<p><span m="2525640">It's a little harder now.</span></p>
<p><span m="2528160">What I'm going to is I'm going to run this correlation</span> <span m="2530100">program over this whole image using Nicola's face as a mask</span> <span m="2538000">and seeing where the correlation peaks up, in spite</span> <span m="2540670">of all the noise that's in there.</span></p>
<p><span m="2548290">Boom, there he is.</span></p>
<p><span m="2552780">I don't know, maybe we can find Erica too.</span></p>
<p><span m="2557370">I forgot where she was.</span></p>
<p><span m="2560110">I can't find her.</span></p>
<p><span m="2564740">There she is.</span></p>
<p><span m="2567670">Unfortunately the parameters aren't very good here.</span></p>
<p><span m="2570490">Do you see that?</span></p>
<p><span m="2572890">Let me get another version of this.</span></p>
<p><span m="2575550">I'll just do some real-time programming.</span></p>
<p><span m="2588780">I've been trying to reset the parameters so that the images</span> <span m="2593210">in the demonstration comes out clearly up there.</span></p>
<p><span m="2597070">Let's see if this works a little better.</span></p>
<p><span m="2599680">OK, so let's add some noise.</span></p>
<p><span m="2603860">And let's find Erica.</span></p>
<p><span m="2608750">There she is.</span></p>
<p><span m="2612340">There are some other things that look a</span> <span m="2613290">little bit like Erica.</span></p>
<p><span m="2614550">But nothing looks quite exactly like Erica.</span></p>
<p><span m="2619450">So let's try Nicola's eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2626090">So they stand out pretty clearly against the</span> <span m="2628070">background.</span></p>
<p><span m="2629630">Let's see if we can find Erica's eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2634580">So they stand out pretty clearly against the</span> <span m="2636150">background.</span></p>
<p><span m="2636440">Notice that it also gets Nicola's eyes.</span></p>
<p><span m="2639300">So two eyes is an intermediate-size constraint.</span></p>
<p><span m="2644840">It's loose enough that it will match more than one person.</span></p>
<p><span m="2648780">But it's not so loose that it's as bad as</span> <span m="2652130">looking for one eye.</span></p>
<p><span m="2655050">See, they're all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span m="2657490">So two eyes and a nose, a mouth and a nose, that would</span> <span m="2661640">be even better as an intermediate feature.</span></p>
<p><span m="2663870">But it doesn't matter what the best ones are, because you can</span> <span m="2665875">work that out experimentally.</span></p>
<p><span m="2668620">So that's how correlation works.</span></p>
<p><span m="2670660">And it's just amazing how much noise you can add and it'll</span> <span m="2674690">still pick out the right stuff.</span></p>
<p><span m="2679160">There's Nicola.</span></p>
<p><span m="2679780">Boom.</span></p>
<p><span m="2681080">Very clear.</span></p>
<p><span m="2683290">Want to add some more noise?</span></p>
<p><span m="2686790">I don't know, I can see it, but that's because I'm a</span> <span m="2689640">pretty good correlator, too.</span></p>
<p><span m="2695300">Boom.</span></p>
<p><span m="2696500">I don't know, let's add some more noise.</span></p>
<p><span m="2704420">It's just hard to get rid of it.</span></p>
<p><span m="2706480">It's just amazing how well it picks it out.</span></p>
<p><span m="2709650">That's good.</span></p>
<p><span m="2710400">That's cool.</span></p>
<p><span m="2712640">Now, but the reason that this is 30 years and we're still</span> <span m="2716690">not done is there are still some questions.</span></p>
<p><span m="2719340">This is recognizing stuff straight on.</span></p>
<p><span m="2722730">How is it I can recognize you in the hall from the side?</span></p>
<p><span m="2725260">Nobody knows.</span></p>
<p><span m="2727600">One possibility is that you have an ability to make those</span> <span m="2731830">transformations.</span></p>
<p><span m="2732630">If so, then that alignment theory has a role to play.</span></p>
<p><span m="2737410">Another theory is that, well, after I've seen you once I can</span> <span m="2741360">watch you turn your head and keep recording what you look</span> <span m="2744680">like at all possible angles.</span></p>
<p><span m="2747220">That would work.</span></p>
<p><span m="2748480">The trouble is, is there enough stuff in there?</span></p>
<p><span m="2752150">Maybe.</span></p>
<p><span m="2752650">We don't know.</span></p>
<p><span m="2755770">Now what would it take to break this mechanism?</span></p>
<p><span m="2759040">Well, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span m="2759910">Let's just see if we can break the mechanism.</span></p>
<p><span m="2768600">Let's see if you can recognize some well-known faces.</span></p>
<p><span m="2775820">Who's that?</span></p>
<p><span m="2776400">Quick.</span></p>
<p><span m="2777430">STUDENT: Obama.</span></p>
<p><span m="2778540">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, that's too easy.</span></p>
<p><span m="2781290">We'll see if we can make some harder ones.</span></p>
<p><span m="2785930">Yeah, that's Obama.</span></p>
<p><span m="2786955">Who's this?</span></p>
<p><span m="2788280">STUDENT: Bush.</span></p>
<p><span m="2789600">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh boy.</span></p>
<p><span m="2789940">You're really good at this.</span></p>
<p><span m="2791440">That's Bush.</span></p>
<p><span m="2792200">How about this guy?</span></p>
<p><span m="2792960">STUDENT: Kerry.</span></p>
<p><span m="2798680">PATRICK WINSTON: OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="2799000">Now I've got it.</span></p>
<p><span m="2799780">Some people are starting to turn their heads.</span></p>
<p><span m="2801220">And that's not fair.</span></p>
<p><span m="2802722">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="2804200">PATRICK WINSTON: That's not fair.</span></p>
<p><span m="2806030">Because you see what's happened is that if this kind</span> <span m="2809070">of pumpkin in theory is correct, then when you turn</span> <span m="2812500">the face upside down you lose the correlation of those</span> <span m="2816020">features that have vertical components.</span></p>
<p><span m="2818740">So if you have two eyes and a nose, they won't match two</span> <span m="2821570">eyes and a nose when they're turned upside down.</span></p>
<p><span m="2824890">Well, let's see.</span></p>
<p><span m="2825590">We'll try some more.</span></p>
<p><span m="2828470">Who's that?</span></p>
<p><span m="2830514">STUDENT: Gorbachev.</span></p>
<p><span m="2831370">PATRICK WINSTON: Gorbachev.</span></p>
<p><span m="2831800">Who said that?</span></p>
<p><span m="2833120">Leonid, where are you?</span></p>
<p><span m="2834575">This is Gorbachev, right?</span></p>
<p><span m="2835430">You can recognize him because of the little birthmark on the</span> <span m="2838340">top of his head.</span></p>
<p><span m="2840150">One more.</span></p>
<p><span m="2841105">Who's--</span> <span m="2842275">oh, that's easy.</span></p>
<p><span m="2843140">Who is it?</span></p>
<p><span m="2846050">That's Clinton.</span></p>
<p><span m="2848050">How about this one?</span></p>
<p><span m="2854520">Do you see how insulting it is to be at MIT?</span></p>
<p><span m="2859000">That's me.</span></p>
<p><span m="2860076">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="2863480">PATRICK WINSTON: And you didn't even know.</span></p>
<p><span m="2866720">Oh, god.</span></p>
<p><span m="2872770">So this might be evidence for the correlation theory.</span></p>
<p><span m="2877700">But of course, turning the face upside down would make it</span> <span m="2881280">very difficult to do alignment, too.</span></p>
<p><span m="2882860">So it would break out alignment theory, as well.</span></p>
<p><span m="2886060">Let me get that after class, Was there a mistake, or?</span></p>
<p><span m="2889045">STUDENT: No, no.</span></p>
<p><span m="2889500">I was just curious [INAUDIBLE] stretching would break the</span> <span m="2893430">correlation.</span></p>
<p><span m="2894140">PATRICK WINSTON: If what would break the structure?</span></p>
<p><span m="2895461">What?</span></p>
<p><span m="2896383">Stretching?</span></p>
<p><span m="2896844">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="2900120">PATRICK WINSTON: Elliot asked if stretching would break the</span> <span m="2901800">correlation.</span></p>
<p><span m="2902970">And the answer is, I think, stretching in the vertical</span> <span m="2910800">dimension is worse than stretching in</span> <span m="2913290">the horizontal dimension.</span></p>
<p><span m="2914790">Because you get a certain amount of stretching in the</span> <span m="2916455">horizontal dimension when you just turn your head.</span></p>
<p><span m="2918700">By the way, since our faces are basically mounted on a</span> <span m="2921450">cylinder, this kind of transformation</span> <span m="2925550">might actually work.</span></p>
<p><span m="2926890">That's a sidebar to the answer to your question, Elliot.</span></p>
<p><span m="2931140">But now you say, well, OK, so this is not completely solved.</span></p>
<p><span m="2933730">You can work this out.</span></p>
<p><span m="2935980">But if you really want to work something out, let me tell you</span> <span m="2939430">what the current questions are in computer vision.</span></p>
<p><span m="2943570">People have worked for an awful long time on this</span> <span m="2945090">recognition stuff and, to my mind, have neglected the more</span> <span m="2956010">serious questions.</span></p>
<p><span m="2958900">It's more serious questions are, how do you visually</span> <span m="2961030">determine what's happening?</span></p>
<p><span m="2964150">If you could write a program that would reliably determine</span> <span m="2968280">when these verbs are happening in your field of view, I will</span> <span m="2971520">sign your Ph.D. thesis tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span m="2972970">There are 48 of them there.</span></p>
<p><span m="2975680">And that is today's challenge.</span></p>
<p><span m="2977610">But since we're short on time, I want to skip over that and</span> <span m="2980630">perform an experiment on you.</span></p>
<p><span m="2982800">I want you to tell me what I'm doing.</span></p>
<p><span m="2984892">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span></p>
<p><span m="2986600">PATRICK WINSTON: So the best single-word answer is?</span></p>
<p><span m="2989960">[INAUDIBLE]?</span></p>
<p><span m="2991090">STUDENT: Drinking.</span></p>
<p><span m="2991490">PATRICK WINSTON: OK, this is not a trick question.</span></p>
<p><span m="2994020">OK, the best single-word answer.</span></p>
<p><span m="2996500">Christopher, what do you think?</span></p>
<p><span m="2997778">STUDENT: Toasting.</span></p>
<p><span m="2999272">PATRICK WINSTON: Christopher.</span></p>
<p><span m="3000770">Well, you.</span></p>
<p><span m="3002942">You.</span></p>
<p><span m="3004874">STUDENT: Toasting.</span></p>
<p><span m="3006330">PATRICK WINSTON: What?</span></p>
<p><span m="3007910">Toasting.</span></p>
<p><span m="3009298">OK.</span></p>
<p><span m="3009782">Not a trick question.</span></p>
<p><span m="3012690">What's happening here?</span></p>
<p><span m="3018066">Best single-word answer?</span></p>
<p><span m="3020878">STUDENT: Drinking.</span></p>
<p><span m="3021786">PATRICK WINSTON: Is drinking.</span></p>
<p><span m="3024060">Which pair look more alike?</span></p>
<p><span m="3025846">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="3032170">PATRICK WINSTON: So that cat is drinking and nobody has any</span> <span m="3034210">trouble recognizing that.</span></p>
<p><span m="3035500">And I believe it's because you're telling a story.</span></p>
<p><span m="3043280">So our power of storytelling even reaches down into our</span> <span m="3046260">visual apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span m="3047620">So the story here is that some animal has evidently had an</span> <span m="3052720">urge to find something to drink and water is passing</span> <span m="3056860">through that animal's mouth.</span></p>
<p><span m="3057920">That's the drinking story.</span></p>
<p><span m="3059720">So even though they look enormously different visually,</span> <span m="3062520">the stuff at the bottom of our vision system provides enough</span> <span m="3065360">evidence for our story apparatus so that we can give</span> <span m="3068910">the left one and the right one different labels and recognize</span> <span m="3072300">the cat is drinking.</span></p>
<p><span m="3076410">And that's the end of the story.</span></p>

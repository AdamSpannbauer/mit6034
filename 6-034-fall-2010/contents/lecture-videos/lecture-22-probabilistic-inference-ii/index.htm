<p><strong>Description:</strong> We begin with a review of inference nets, then discuss how to use experimental data to develop a model, which can be used to perform simulations. If we have two competing models, we can use Bayes' rule to determine which is more likely to be accurate.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Patrick H. Winston</p>

<p><span m="9890">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: I was in Washington for most of</span> <span m="11320">the week prospecting for gold.</span> </p>
<p><span m="15050">Another byproduct of that was that I forgot to arrange a</span> <span m="19820">substitute Bob Berwick for the Thursday recitations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="25330">I shall probably go to hell for this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="28070">In any event, we have many explanations,</span> <span m="31830">none of them good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="34670">But today we'll try to get back on track and you'll learn</span> <span m="38680">something fun.</span> </p>
<p><span m="40800">In particular you will learn how a graduate student of mine</span> <span m="48060">Mark [? Phillipson ?], together with a summer UROP</span> <span m="51940">student, Brett van Zuiden, one of you--</span> <span m="58710">managed to pull off a tour de force and recognize in these</span> <span m="62390">two descriptions the pattern that we humans commonly call</span> <span m="66610">"revenge." It was discovered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69860">The system didn't have a name for it, of course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="73090">It just knew that there was a pattern there and sat waiting</span> <span m="76160">for us to give a name to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="77340">That's where we're going to end up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="80635">But it'll be a bit of a journey before we get there,</span> <span m="82840">because we've got to go through all that</span> <span m="84039">stuff on the outline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="86250">And in particular, we want to start off by a</span> <span m="89740">little tiny bit of review.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90910">Because some of the stuff we did last time</span> <span m="93310">went by pretty fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="96440">In particular, you may remember they had this</span> <span m="99630">wonderful joint probability table, which tells us all we</span> <span m="102220">want to know, all we want to know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="105229">We can decide what the probability of the police</span> <span m="108950">being called is given the this and the that, and all that</span> <span m="112520">sort of stuff, by clicking the appropriate boxes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="116080">The trouble is, gee, there are only three variables there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120920">And when there are lots of variables it gets pretty hard</span> <span m="123560">to make up those numbers or to even collect them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="127010">So we're driven to an alternative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="128550">And we got to that alternative just at the end of</span> <span m="131890">the show a week ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="135210">And we got to the point where we were defining these</span> <span m="141750">inference nets, sometimes called "Bayes nets." And the</span> <span m="145370">one we worked with looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="149579">There's a burglar, a raccoon, the possibility of a dog</span> <span m="153060">barking, the police being called, and a trash can being</span> <span m="156500">overturned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="158720">So more variables than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="160620">That only has three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="161579">This has got five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="164420">But we're able to do some magic with this because we, as</span> <span m="167590">humans, when we define--</span> <span m="168960">when we draw this graph we're making an assertion about how</span> <span m="172130">things depend or don't depend on one another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="175740">In particular, there's something to break down and</span> <span m="180410">memorize to the point where it rolls off your tongue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="183240">And that is that any variable on this graph is said by me to</span> <span m="188240">be independent of any other</span> <span m="190310">non-descendant given its parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194500">Independent of any</span> <span m="195770">non-descendant given its parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="199690">So that means that the probability of the dog</span> <span m="201930">barking, given its parents, doesn't depend on T, the trash</span> <span m="207340">can being overturned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="208930">Because the intuition is all of the causality is flowing</span> <span m="212900">through the parents and can't get to this variable D without</span> <span m="218800">going through the parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="221440">So that is [? inserted ?]</span> <span m="222680">property of the nets that we draw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="224290">And we tend to draw them in a way that reflects causality.</span> </p>
<p><span m="226960">So it tends to make sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="229000">So somehow this thing is going to be--</span> <span m="236329">we're going to use this thing instead of that thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="239710">But wait.</span> </p>
<p><span m="240880">We may need that thing in order to do all the</span> <span m="242920">computations we want to perform.</span> </p>
<p><span m="245530">So we need to be able to show that we can get to that thing</span> <span m="249930">by doing calculations on this thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="255160">So what to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="258300">Well, we're going to use the chain rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="260100">And remember that the chain rule came to us by way of the</span> <span m="263450">basic Axioms of Probability plus the definition plus a</span> <span m="268250">little colored chalk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="270580">So we got to the point last time where we</span> <span m="273570">sort of believed this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="274750">It's a really magical thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="275920">It says that the probability of all this stuff happening</span> <span m="278670">together is given as the product of a bunch of</span> <span m="282170">conditional probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="284470">And the conditional probabilities in this product</span> <span m="287380">are arranged such that this first guy depends</span> <span m="289430">on everybody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="291500">The second guy doesn't depend on the first guy but depends</span> <span m="294050">on everything else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="295690">So that list of dependencies gets smaller and smaller as</span> <span m="298850">you go down here until it depends only one thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="301380">There's no conditional at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="305050">So that's going to come to our rescue because it enables us</span> <span m="308780">to go from calculations in here to that whole table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="314210">But first I have to show you a little bit more slowly how</span> <span m="317740">that comes to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="319720">One thing I'm going to do before I think about</span> <span m="321800">probability is I'm going to make a linear list of all</span> <span m="325650">these variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="327330">And the way I'm going to make it is I'm going to chew away</span> <span m="329290">at those variables from the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="332030">I've taken advantage of a very important</span> <span m="333810">property of these nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="336630">And that is there no loops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="339490">You can follow the arrows in any way so as</span> <span m="343090">you get back to yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="345470">So there's always going to be a bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="348200">So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, well, there are</span> <span m="350300">two bottoms here, there's C and T. So I have a choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="353409">I'm going to choose C. So I'm going to take that off and</span> <span m="362330">pretend it's not there anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="365570">Then I'm going to take this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366980">That's now a bottom because there's nothing below it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="369430">I've already taken C out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371430">So we'll take that out next.</span> </p>
<p><span m="374590">And now I've got this guy, this guy, and this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="378440">This guy no longer has anything below it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="381170">So I can list it next.</span> </p>
<p><span m="383430">Now over here I've got raccoon and trashcan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="386590">But trashcan is at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="390450">So I've got to take it next because I'm working</span> <span m="394040">from the bottom up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="396011">I want to ensure that there are no descendants before me</span> <span m="400760">in this list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="402940">So finally I get to raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="405780">So the way I constructed this list like so ensures that this</span> <span m="411930">list arranges the elements so that for any particular</span> <span m="415020">element, none of its descendants</span> <span m="417210">appear to its left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421300">And now that's the magical order for which I want to use</span> <span m="424260">the chain rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="426030">So now I can write--</span> <span m="427960">I can pick C to be my variable n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431260">And I can say that the chain rule says that the joint</span> <span m="433530">probability of all these variables P of C,</span> <span m="437410">D, B, T, and R--</span> <span m="442140">the probability of any particular combination of</span> <span m="444360">those things is equal to the probability of C given</span> <span m="448140">everybody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="453659">Next in line is D given everybody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="462470">Next in line is T--</span> <span m="465400">next in line is B given everybody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="477380">And next in line is T given everybody else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483270">And finally, just R. So this combination of things has a</span> <span m="490840">probability that is given by this chain rule expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="495960">Ah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="497010">But first of all, none of those expressions condition</span> <span m="499500">any of the variables on anything other than</span> <span m="501740">non-descendants, all right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="505970">That's just because of the way I've arranged the variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="508650">And I can always do that because are no loops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="510950">I can always chew away at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="513169">That ensures that whenever I write a variable, it's going</span> <span m="515140">to be conditioned on stuff other than its descendants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="519440">So all of these variables in any of these conditional</span> <span m="523190">probabilities are non-descendants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="526700">Oh wait.</span> </p>
<p><span m="528740">When I drew this diagram, I asserted that no variable</span> <span m="534510">depends on any non-descendant given its parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="538680">So if I know the parents of a variable I know that the</span> <span m="542950">variable is independent of all other non-descendants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="545895">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="547320">Now I can start scratching stuff out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="550590">Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="551690">I know that C, from my diagram, has only one parent,</span> <span m="556120">D. So given its parent, it's independent of all other</span> <span m="561080">non-descendants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="562730">So I can scratch them out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="567370">D he has two parents, B and R. But given that, I can scratch</span> <span m="573470">out any other non-descendant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="577190">B is conditional on T and R. Ah, but B has no parent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="581460">So it actually is independent of those two guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="585120">The trashcan, yeah, that's dependent on R. And R over</span> <span m="588330">here, the final thing in the chain, that's just a</span> <span m="590640">probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="593160">So now I have a way of calculating any entry in that</span> <span m="596390">table because any entry in that table is going to be some</span> <span m="598960">combination of values for all those variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="602880">Voila.</span> </p>
<p><span m="604440">So anything I can do with a table, I can do in principle</span> <span m="608320">with this little network.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610580">OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="611920">But now the question is, I've got some probabilities I'm</span> <span m="615480">going to have to figure out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="617100">So let me draw a slightly different version of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="626010">So up here we've got the a priori probability of B. Well,</span> <span m="632030">that's just probability of B. Down here with the dog, I've</span> <span m="646680">got a bigger table because I've got probabilities that</span> <span m="650350">depend on the values of its parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="652950">The probability of dog barking depends on the condition of</span> <span m="657620">the parents, nothing else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660560">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="661070">I've got to have a column for B. I've got to have a column</span> <span m="663920">for the burglar and the raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="668660">And there are a bunch of possibilities for those guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="671940">But once I get those then I'll be able to calculate the</span> <span m="674050">probability of the dog barking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="678640">So there are two of these variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="679910">So there are four combinations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="682310">There's T T. There's T R, R T, and--</span> <span m="690390">whoa, what am I doing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="692134">Wake up!</span> </p>
<p><span m="694050">T false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="696720">False true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="697930">And false false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="699890">So what I really want to do is I want to calculate all of</span> <span m="702060">these probabilities that give the probability of the dog</span> <span m="705070">condition of the burglar and the raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="709210">Similarly, I want to calculate the probability of B happening</span> <span m="713070">doesn't depend on anything else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="716200">So I don't know what to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="718590">Well, what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to do</span> <span m="720660">the same thing I had to do up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="723410">I'm going to keep track of--</span> <span m="726630">I'm going to try a bunch of--</span> <span m="727640">I'm going to get myself together a bunch of data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="729560">Maybe I do a bunch of experiments.</span> </p>
<p><span m="730910">Maybe somebody hands it to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="732730">But I'm going to use that data to construct a bunch of</span> <span m="736030">tallies which are going to end up giving me the probabilities</span> <span m="739990">for all of those things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="742150">So I don't know, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="743160">How should we start?</span> </p>
<p><span m="745440">Step one, find colored chalk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="747290">Step two, I'm going to extend these tables a little bit so I</span> <span m="750870">can keep track of the tallies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758840">So this is going to be all the ones that end up in a</span> <span m="761580">particular row.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762980">And these are going to be the ones for which dog is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="770930">Similarly, I'm going to extend this guy up here in order to</span> <span m="773960">keep track of some tallies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="776020">This is going to be the ones for which B is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="782990">And this one will be all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="786780">So that's my set up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="788680">And now suppose that my first experiment comes roaring in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="792490">And it's all T's.</span> </p>
<p><span m="795060">So I have T T T. That's my first experimental result, my</span> <span m="801720">first data item.</span> </p>
<p><span m="804170">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="807480">The arrangement here is burglar, raccoon, dog.</span> </p>
<p><span m="811010">So burglar as a true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815040">And there's one tally count in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="818510">Likewise, the T T, that's the burglar and the raccoon, that</span> <span m="822280">brings me down to this first row.</span> </p>
<p><span m="825190">So that gives me one tally in there and dog is true so that</span> <span m="829200">gives me a tick mark in that one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="832475">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="833190">Are you with me so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="834240">And now let's suppose that the next thing</span> <span m="835850">happens be all false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="841940">Well, burglar is false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844020">But there is one experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="848590">Everybody's false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="849980">So we come down here to false false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="853500">And that's the row we're going to work on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="854810">We get a tally in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856650">Do we put one in here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="859150">No, because that's false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="861860">Dog is false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862785">That's what our data element says.</span> </p>
<p><span m="865650">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="866640">Maybe one more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="868050">Let's suppose we have T T F. Well in that case, we have a</span> <span m="877210">tick mark here and a tick mark here because the burglar</span> <span m="882020">element is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="884360">Then we have T T. That brings us to the first row again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="888040">So we get a tick mark there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="890180">But dog as false, so no tick mark there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="893500">That's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="895170">I suppose you'd like to see a demonstration, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="898550">Always like to see a demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901030">So here's what it actually looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905680">So on the left you see the network as we've constructed</span> <span m="910060">it, with a bunch probabilities there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="912420">And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to start</span> <span m="913850">simulating away so as to accumulate tick marks, tally</span> <span m="917850">marks, and see what kinds of probabilities that they</span> <span m="920160">indicate for the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="921920">I happen to be using a process for which the model on the</span> <span m="925610">left is a correct reflection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="929070">So there's one simulation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="931540">So the dog barking--</span> <span m="933460">let's see, the burglar is false.</span> </p>
<p><span m="934800">The raccoon is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="936600">I get one tick mark.</span> </p>
<p><span m="937710">So the probability there is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="940130">Of course, I'm not going to just go with one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943300">I want to put a whole bunch of stuff in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="944840">So I'll just run a bunch more simulations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="950820">No [? dice. ?]</span> <span m="951270">I don't even have an entry at all yet for T F here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="954746">That's because I haven't run enough data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957210">So let me clear it instead of doing it one at a time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="960280">Let me run 100 simulations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="962280">See, it's still not too good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="963450">Because it says this T T probability true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="967500">This just because I'm feeding it data, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="969910">And I'm keeping track of what the data elements tell me</span> <span m="972730">about how frequently a</span> <span m="975470">particular combination appears.</span> </p>
<p><span m="977180">Yes, [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="977680">STUDENT: So when you're doing one simulation, is that</span> <span m="980668">[INAUDIBLE] variables?</span> </p>
<p><span m="982162">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: When I'm doing one simulation,</span> <span m="983832">I'm just keeping track of that combination in</span> <span m="986930">each of these tables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="988800">Because it's going to tell me something about the</span> <span m="990630">probabilities that I want reflected in those tables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="993730">So it's pretty easy to see when I go up here to burglar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="997090">If I have a lot of data elements, they're all going to</span> <span m="998920">tell me something about the burglar as well</span> <span m="1000730">as the other variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1002280">So if I just look at that burglar thing, the fraction of</span> <span m="1004910">time that it turns out true over all the data elements is</span> <span m="1007850">going to be its probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1010150">So now when I go down to the joint tables, I can still get</span> <span m="1013610">these probability numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1014630">But now they're conditioned on reticular</span> <span m="1016400">condition of its parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1019010">So that's how I get these probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1021430">So I didn't do too well here because that T T combination</span> <span m="1024700">gave me an excessively high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1026579">So maybe 100 simulations isn't enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1030130">Let's run 10,000.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1035339">So with that much data running through, the probabilities I</span> <span m="1038560">get-- let's see, I've got 893 here, instead of 0.9, 807</span> <span m="1042310">instead of 0.8, 607 instead of 0.6.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1045880">And that one's dead-on at 0.01.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1048500">So if I run enough of these simulations, I get a pretty</span> <span m="1050570">good idea what the probabilities ought to be</span> <span m="1053220">given that I've got a correct model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1057030">OK, so that takes care of that one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058860">And of course, I didn't draw the other things in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1060880">But by extension, you can see how those would work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1064800">Oh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066180">But you know what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066810">I think I will put a little probability of</span> <span m="1068895">raccoon table in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1072550">Because the next thing I want to do is I want to</span> <span m="1075390">go the other way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1076470">This is recoding tallies from some process so I</span> <span m="1079365">can develop a model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1080730">But once I've got these probabilities, of course, then</span> <span m="1083670">I can start to simulate what the model would do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1087780">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1088610">How would I do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1090690">Well, do I want to use the same table?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1096220">I think just to keep things sanitary, what I'll do is I'll</span> <span m="1099050">go over here and do it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1101340">Here's B. It's got a probability of B. Here's R.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1107260">Here's a table probability of R. That comes down into a</span> <span m="1113300">joint table for dog.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1116070">And it's got four elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1124090">Depending on the burglar condition and the raccoon</span> <span m="1126940">condition, we get a probability of dog.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1131270">And now, imagine these have all been filled in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1133990">So what do I want to do if I want to simulate this system</span> <span m="1137290">generating some combination of values for all the variables?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1142130">Well, I do the opposite of what I did when I was working</span> <span m="1145870">around with this chain rule showing that I could go from</span> <span m="1149070">the table to those probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1151480">Now I've got the probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152660">I'm going to go the other direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1154450">Instead of chewing away from the bottom, I'm going to chew</span> <span m="1157100">away from the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1158660">Because when I go into the top and chew way, everything I</span> <span m="1161740">need to know to do a coin flip is there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1164560">So in particular, when I go up in here, I've got the</span> <span m="1168970">probability of burglar now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1171350">So I'm going to use that probability to flip a coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176250">Say it produces a T. So that takes care of this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1180950">And I can now scratch it off since it's no longer in</span> <span m="1183730">consideration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1184390">It's no longer a top variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1186940">So now I go over into raccoon and I do the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189330">I take this probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1191190">I do a flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1193310">And say it produces an F. Whatever its probability is, I</span> <span m="1199130">flip a biased coin and that's what I happen to get.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1202350">But now, having dealt with these two guys, that uncovers</span> <span m="1206340">this dog thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1208230">And I've got enough information, because I've done</span> <span m="1210330">everything above, to make the calculation for whether to dog</span> <span m="1213286">is going to be barking or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1215510">But wait.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1216520">I have to know that I've got a T and a T and a T and an F and</span> <span m="1222530">an F and a T and an F and an F. Because I have to select</span> <span m="1227060">the right row.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1228820">So I know that B is T. And I know that R is F. So that</span> <span m="1234610">takes me into the table into the second row.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1239570">So now I get this probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1242360">I flip that coin and I get some result, say, T. Voila.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1249850">I can do that with the other two variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1251810">And I've got myself an experimental trial that is</span> <span m="1255390">produced in accordance with the</span> <span m="1256620">probabilities of the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1259219">OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1263390">Of course--</span> <span m="1268356">yeah, in fact, how did I get those numbers?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273730">Actually what I did is I used the model on the left to</span> <span m="1276990">generate the samples that were used to compute the</span> <span m="1279330">probabilities on the right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282240">So you've seen that a demonstration of this already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1287910">Now of course--</span> <span m="1291330">I don't know, all of this sort of depends on having</span> <span m="1296400">everything right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1298030">I've written a thing to write it one more time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1302130">Burglar, raccoon, dog, call the police, trashcan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1311580">But somebody else may say, oh, you've got it all wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314440">This is what it really looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318560">The dog doesn't care about the raccoon at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1321780">So that's a correct model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1324130">Now when I do a simulation, I could fill in the tables in</span> <span m="1326380">either model, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1327810">I'm sure you'd like to see a demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330800">So let me show you a demonstration of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1341470">So there are the two tables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1343040">And I can run 10,000 simulations</span> <span m="1345060">on those guys, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1348530">Now, look.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1349270">The guy on the left is a pretty good reflection of the</span> <span m="1351150">probabilities in a model I used to produce the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1357630">But the guy on the right doesn't know any better. it</span> <span m="1359253">just fills in its own tables, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1362960">So what to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1365950">I say this one's the right model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1368060">And you say that one's the right model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1370370">Who's right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1372090">Maybe we'll never know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1374120">And the guy on the left will get rich in the stock market</span> <span m="1377830">and the guy on the right will go broke.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380630">I would be nice if we could actually</span> <span m="1381370">figure out who's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384520">So would you to see how to figure out who's right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387466">Yeah, so would I. What we're going to do is we're going to</span> <span m="1389220">look at naive Bayesian inference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391490">And that's our next chore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1393660">So here's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396740">We know, from the definition of conditional probability, we</span> <span m="1400800">know that the probability of A given B is equal to the</span> <span m="1405530">probability of A and B divided by the</span> <span m="1409660">probability of B, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1413520">Equal to by definition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1416400">So that means that the probability of A given B times</span> <span m="1423540">the probability of B--</span> <span m="1425240">I'm just multiplying it out--</span> <span m="1426680">it equal to that joint probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1432690">Oh, but by symmetry, there's no harm in saying I can turn</span> <span m="1437715">that around and say that the probability of B given A times</span> <span m="1442450">the probability of B is also equal to that joint</span> <span m="1447000">probability, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448690">I've just expanded it a different and symmetric way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452750">If I've got to write a, b on B, b, a on A. Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1458630">Who was complaining?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1459590">Good work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1464200">That would have been a major-league disaster.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1467800">But now, having written that, I can forget about the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470910">Because all I'm really interested in is how I've</span> <span m="1472730">turned the probabilities around in that conditional.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1477070">Why would I care about doing that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1478570">By the way, we're now talking about the work of</span> <span m="1481760">the Reverend Bayes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1487060">Because we can rewrite this yet again as the probability</span> <span m="1490420">of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times</span> <span m="1500160">the probability of A divided by the probability of B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1506420">That's just elementary algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509790">But now I'm going to do something magical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1513460">I'm going to say I've got a classification problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518670">I want to know which disease you have.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1522120">That's a classification problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1523660">Maybe you've got the swine flu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526120">Maybe you've got indigestion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1529790">Who knows.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1530740">But I get all these symptoms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533470">I get all these pieces of evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535950">You've got a fever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1537450">You're throwing--</span> <span m="1538140">oh, well, let's not go into too much detail, there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1540470">But what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, well, let's</span> <span m="1542060">suppose that A is equal to a class that I'm interested in,</span> <span m="1548490">the disease you've got.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550050">And B is equal to the evidence,</span> <span m="1556510">the symptoms I observe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1560540">Voila.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1562240">I may have a pretty hard time figuring out what the</span> <span m="1564150">probability of the class is given the evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1567260">But figuring out the probability of the evidence</span> <span m="1568920">given the class might not be so hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1571420">Let me get another board in play and show you what I mean.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1580128">By plugging class and evidence into Bayes' rule, what I get</span> <span m="1584820">is the probability of some class given the evidence is</span> <span m="1591540">equal to the probability of the evidence given the class</span> <span m="1597710">times the probability of the class divided by the</span> <span m="1602060">probability of the evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1606280">Now you've got to let that sing to you a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1609230">Suppose I've got several classes that I'm trying to</span> <span m="1611590">decide between.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1614270">I'm trying to select the best out of that batch of classes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1618500">Well, I've got the evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1619800">And if I know the probability of the evidence given each of</span> <span m="1622140">those classes, and if I know, a priori, the initial</span> <span m="1626130">probability the class, then I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629950">Because I've got the two elements in the numerator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632910">Why am I done?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1634590">Because the denominator is the same for all the classes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1638630">It's just the probability of the evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641490">And then I could just sum everything up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1642870">I know it adds to 1 anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1645440">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1647440">But sometimes there's evidence--</span> <span m="1651240">actually there's more than one piece of evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1653980">Let's say that there's some class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1655660">some i, and we're trying to figure out if that's the</span> <span m="1658330">correct class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1659720">So we've got c sub i there and c sub i there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1663000">And suppose that that evidence is actually a bunch of pieces</span> <span m="1666420">of evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667780">So it could be e sub 1, e sub n, oops,</span> <span m="1676580">premature right bracket.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1678880">All that evidence, given the class i times the probability</span> <span m="1683430">of the class i over some denominator that we don't care</span> <span m="1687820">about because it's going to be the same for everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1691700">So we'll just write that as d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1695110">Now what if these pieces of evidence are all independent</span> <span m="1699160">given the class?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702720">So if you have the swine flu, the probability you have a</span> <span m="1705590">fever is independent of the probability you're going to</span> <span m="1708117">throw up, say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1711610">Then can we write this another way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714280">An easier way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1715150">Sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1716580">Because when things are independent, the joint</span> <span m="1719180">probability is equal to the product of the individual</span> <span m="1724330">probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725190">So that is to say--</span> <span m="1726910">it's easier to see it if you write it down than if</span> <span m="1728670">you just say it--</span> <span m="1729700">this probability here from these two elements here is</span> <span m="1734200">equal to the probability of e sub 1 conditioned on c sub i</span> <span m="1739280">times the probability of e sub 2 conditioned on c sub i, all</span> <span m="1744970">the way down to the probability of e sub n</span> <span m="1748080">conditioned on c sub i divided by some denominator we don't</span> <span m="1754800">care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1756480">See, what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to go through</span> <span m="1758860">this for all the ci and see which one's the biggest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762240">STUDENT: That's the [INAUDIBLE] ci, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1766390">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: This is the probability of--</span> <span m="1769070">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1771470">right-hand side [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1773870">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Right here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1775990">Oh yes, you're quite right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1778820">Oh yeah, thanks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1785270">I can't write and think at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1786775">Thanks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789410">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789770">So I've just figure out which one of these is the biggest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1791700">And I've identified the class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1794150">Now you say to me, well, I would like to see an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1797490">So--</span> <span m="1799870">I don't know, does anyone have any spare change?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1804660">A nickel, a quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1807300">This is not because of infinitesimally low raises</span> <span m="1811190">here at MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1811960">I just need it for a demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815180">I need two coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1817180">Don't forget to get these back, I tend to be--</span> <span m="1819140">Now suppose these two coins are not exactly the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823280">One of these points is a legitimate, highly-prized</span> <span m="1828200">American quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1830160">The other one is a fake.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1832100">And with this one, the probability of heads, let us</span> <span m="1833960">say, is 0.8 instead of 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1839050">So I mix these all up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1841710">And I pick one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1843960">And I start flipping it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1846520">And I get a head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1849540">Then I flip it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1852390">And I get a tail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1855040">Which coin did I pick?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1858750">Well, we're going to use this stuff to figure it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1862480">Here's what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1876940">Before I forget.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1878500">Thank you very much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1880440">So what we've done is we've selected these</span> <span m="1882430">things from my hands.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1883810">And I can't draw hands.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884390">So I'll draw a little cup here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1887210">And there are two coins in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1888700">And we're going to pick one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1889610">And one has a probability of heads equal to 0.8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1895690">And this one has a probability of a head of 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1903480">So here's the draw.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1905900">I pick one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1907060">Each has a probability of 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1912260">This one is the one with the 0.8 as the</span> <span m="1916020">probability of head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1917300">And this one is the one with the</span> <span m="1918500">probability of 0.5 as a head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923270">OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1925570">So now suppose the first flips as it was is T. Well, that's a</span> <span m="1932910">piece of evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934382">That's here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1935310">Probably of evidence given the class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1938230">Well in the case of having drawn this biased coin, the</span> <span m="1942240">probability of coming up with a tail-- ah, let's say a head,</span> <span m="1949740">just to make my numbers a little easier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1950890">Probability of coming out there with a head is equal 0.8</span> <span m="1958010">given that it's up here in this choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1960810">The probability given that you have a fair coin is 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969260">So now if we take the next coin and take it to be a tail</span> <span m="1979230">then the probability of this guy given</span> <span m="1982990">that evidence is 0.2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1986610">And the probability of this guy given that evidence-- it's</span> <span m="1988900">a fair coin, so it doesn't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1991050">It's still 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1994250">So now what's the probability of this</span> <span m="1996100">class given this evidence?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1999710">It's the product 0.5 times 0.8 times 0.2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005804">And what's the probability of this guy?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2008590">It's 05 times 0.5 times 0.5, divided by a denominator which</span> <span m="2014800">is the same in both cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2017520">So let's forget about this early 0.5 here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2020230">Because it's the same in both cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028300">And we just multiply those numbers together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2030660">That gives us 0.8 times 0.2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2032940">What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033440">0.16?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2037030">And this guy, 0.5 times 0.5, that's 0.25.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2041010">So it looks an awful lot like-- with this combination--</span> <span m="2044610">that I've picked the coin that's fair.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048050">One more flip?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2050260">So let's flip it again, and suppose we</span> <span m="2051870">come up with a head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2053498">So that puts a 0.8 in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2056520">And 0.5 in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2059170">When you multiply those out that's 0.125.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2069590">And this is 0.128.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2074980">So it's about equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2077830">So you see how that works?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080333">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2081630">So we're using the coin flips as evidence to figure out</span> <span m="2084560">which class is involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2087239">OK so I don't know, you'd probably like to see a</span> <span m="2089840">demonstration of this, too, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2091370">You say to me, gosh, just two kinds of coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2096270">That's not very interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2097970">Let's try five kinds of coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2103660">So what I want to show you is how the probabilities for all</span> <span m="2108650">these coins-- there are five of them, color-coded--</span> <span m="2111130">how the probabilities vary with a series of flips.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2115700">Let's suppose I've got a head--</span> <span m="2118010">the grey line, by the way, is the fraction of heads--</span> <span m="2122080">so that's going to be one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2122820">Because I'm just doing heads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2124500">You see that black line rising?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2127830">Should look like a rocket.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2129250">That's the probability that the--</span> <span m="2132500">that's the coin which only shows heads, the probability</span> <span m="2135060">of head is 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2138760">And I'm flipping a whole bunch of heads here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2142370">Isn't that cool?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143980">Now what happens if I suddenly put in a tail?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2146920">By the way, you'll no doubt, here one the extreme left--</span> <span m="2150280">the initial probability of the P=0 coin was 0.1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2157300">As soon as I flipped a head that went to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2159950">And it will never get off 0, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2162930">That makes sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2163450">Because if the probability that you'll get a head is 1</span> <span m="2165570">you should never see a tail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2166760">If you ever do, that isn't your coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2169030">What happens now if I interrupt a series of heads</span> <span m="2173260">and produce a tail?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174957">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2176418">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2177392">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178860">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: The black one will go to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180240">What else happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2181655">By the way, the blue one is the one with the highest</span> <span m="2184470">probability of being a head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2187400">[INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="2188670">Boom!</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189850">That blue one shot up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2191720">Not going up slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2192910">It shot up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2195320">Because now the preponderance of evidence with all those</span> <span m="2197640">heads is that I've flipped the coin with a bias of 0.75</span> <span m="2203130">towards heads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2204820">So let's clear this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2206540">Pick any probability you want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207680">0.25, 0.5, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210160">I don't know, let's pick 0.25 since we've been</span> <span m="2212260">at the upper end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2218100">So orange is 0.25.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219650">And sure enough, the probability that I've selected</span> <span m="2222200">the 0.5 coin is going up and up and up and up after the</span> <span m="2226900">original irregularity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2228540">The Law of Large Numbers is setting in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230610">And a probability that I've got that 0.25 coin in play is</span> <span m="2234030">pretty close to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236660">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236910">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239360">Now you say to me, that's awfully nice but stop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2243590">Awfully nice, but not very real-world-ish.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250280">So let me give you another problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2253520">It's well-known that you are, with high probability, of the</span> <span m="2258930">same political persuasion as your parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2262660">So if I wanted to figure out which party a parent belongs</span> <span m="2266620">to, I could look at the party that their</span> <span m="2270140">children belong to, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2273490">So it's just like flipping coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277090">The particular coin I have chosen</span> <span m="2279770">corresponds to the parent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2281680">Individual flips correspond to the political party that the</span> <span m="2285620">child belongs to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2287070">So let's get up a little bit--</span> <span m="2288200">by the way, I wrote all this stuff over the weekend.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2289890">So who knows if any of it will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2291610">But let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293430">A parent party classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2296040">There it is, Democrats and Republicans.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2298530">And now the prior for being a Republican given here is 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2304920">But I don't know, this is a little bit Democratic state.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2307300">So let's adjust that down a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2311780">Somewhere in there might be about right But let's just,</span> <span m="2313640">for the sake of a classroom illustration, go down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2317370">So now the meter is showing the prior probability because</span> <span m="2319650">that's the only thing in the formula so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2321510">I've got no evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2323340">So now let's suppose that child number one is a</span> <span m="2325610">Republican.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2328380">Back to neutral.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2330850">So I've got a low probability that the parent--</span> <span m="2333910">a priori probability that the parent is a Republican and a</span> <span m="2339810">child who's a Republican.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2341870">I notice that 0.2 and 0.8, the conditional is 0.8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345670">And the prior is 0.2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346620">That's why it comes out to balance each other, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2349690">So now if we get another Republican in</span> <span m="2351230">there it goes way up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354080">If I have a Democratic child it goes back down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356860">If I have an equal balance between children then it goes</span> <span m="2359180">way back down because of that prior probability being low.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2362320">So if I make that high, even though the children are</span> <span m="2367280">balanced, I'm still going to have a high probability of</span> <span m="2369865">being a Republican.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2372250">Now let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2373140">If I take that slider there, the conditional probability,</span> <span m="2376180">and drive it to the left here-- let me make that</span> <span m="2379800">equally in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2382180">And let's make that one thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384760">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2385620">What am I doing now?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2387766">If I make the probability less than 0.5, what's that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2392460">That means you're sore at your parents and you want to belong</span> <span m="2394510">to a different party.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2397720">All right, so now, what's next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2402200">Oh gosh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404650">What's next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2409620">This is what's next.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415720">What's next to somewhere?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2418220">Yeah, this is what's next.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420440">This here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2421210">We've got two models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424400">Remember when I said we wanted to decide between them?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2428070">Can we use that Bayesian hack to do that, too?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2430930">Sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2431580">Because we've got these two models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2434790">We've got the probabilities in them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2437770">So now I can take my data and calculate the probability of a</span> <span m="2442490">left model given the data and the probability of the right</span> <span m="2445620">model given the data, multiply that times their a priori</span> <span m="2448780">probabilities, which I'll assume are equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2451860">Then I can do a model selection deal much in</span> <span m="2454710">defiance to what I was hinting at before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2457250">so let's try that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2463330">Whoa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2465720">There are my two models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2468915">Yes, there they are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470460">We've already trained them up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2471850">And they've got their probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2473990">Now what we're going to do is we're going to use the</span> <span m="2475630">original model to simulate the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2478950">So what we're going to do is we're going to simulate draws,</span> <span m="2481350">simulate events, similarly combinations of all variables</span> <span m="2485770">using a model that looks like the one on the left, that is</span> <span m="2490626">the one on the left except for the slight differences in</span> <span m="2492530">probabilities, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494320">Then we're going to do this Bayesian thing and see where</span> <span m="2496570">the meter goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2497880">So we'll run one data point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2500020">Oops, went the wrong way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2501960">Makes me nervous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2502960">I just finished this at 9:15.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2504750">Maybe there's a bug.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2506610">Oops, two data points, swings to the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2509720">Three data points, back to the right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2511140">Of course that's not much data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514070">So let's put some more data in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2516685">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517130">Boom, there it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2518730">Let's try that again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2519480">That was cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521060">So let's run 1,000 simulations and one data point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527050">It bobbles around a little bit and goes</span> <span m="2528780">flat over to the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2529640">Because that is the model that reflects the one that the data</span> <span m="2532630">is generated from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2535480">So now we got Bayesian classification, except now the</span> <span m="2539150">classification has gone one step more and it becomes</span> <span m="2541790">structure discovery.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543440">We've got two choices of structure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545700">And we can use this Bayesian thing to decide which of the</span> <span m="2548660">two structures is best.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2551060">Isn't that cool?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2552150">Well, it's only cool if you could do what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2558950">So if you had two choices--</span> <span m="2562710">you can select between them and pick the best one--</span> <span m="2566210">but there are--</span> <span m="2567490">gosh, for this number of variables, there are a whole</span> <span m="2571120">lot of different networks that satisfy the no looping</span> <span m="2575540">criteria and don't have very many parents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2580952">There's an awful lot of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582770">In fact, if you strict this network to two parents there</span> <span m="2585450">are probably thousands and thousands of possible</span> <span m="2588260">structures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2589590">So do I try them all?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2593390">Probably not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2594340">It's too much work when you get 30 variables or</span> <span m="2596370">something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2599320">So what do you do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600450">We know what to do, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2601740">We're almost veterans a 6034.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2603390">We have to search!</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605750">So what we do is we take the loser and we modified it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2610270">And then we modify it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2611320">And we keep modifying it until we drop dead or we get</span> <span m="2618120">something that we're happy with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620450">So let's see what happens if we change this problem a</span> <span m="2623480">little bit and do structure discover.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625030">We're starting out with nothing linked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2627740">And we're going to just start running this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630380">So what's going to happen is that the</span> <span m="2631600">good guy will prevail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2633690">And the bad guy will be a copy of the good guy</span> <span m="2635990">perturbed in some way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2637150">So it's a random search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2640280">You'll notice that score--</span> <span m="2641380">it's too small for you to read.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2643170">All these things are too small to read.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2644460">Let me make it a little bigger.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2648230">Too small to read, but that number on the right there is</span> <span m="2651130">not the product of the probabilities, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2654240">It's the sum of the logarithms of the probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2659850">They go together, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661780">And the reason you use this instead of the probabilities</span> <span m="2663440">is because these numbers get so small that was a 32-bit</span> <span m="2667590">machine, you eventually lose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2669740">So use the log of the probabilities rather than the</span> <span m="2674730">product of the probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675630">You use the sum of the logs instead of the product of the</span> <span m="2677660">probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2679840">And eventually, you hope that this thing converges on the</span> <span m="2683210">correct interpretation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2684760">But you know what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2685470">This thing is so flat as a space and so a large and so</span> <span m="2690900">telephone pole-like that it's full of local maxima.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696490">So what this program is doing is every once in awhile--</span> <span m="2700670">I think with probability 1 and 10; I forgot what</span> <span m="2702880">parameters I used--</span> <span m="2703883">every once in awhile, it'll do a total radical rearrangement</span> <span m="2708410">of the structures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2709150">In other words, it's a random restart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2711830">It keeps track of the best guy so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2713820">And every once in awhile it does a totally random restart</span> <span m="2716370">in its effort to search the space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2718870">So that's how you go from probabilistic inference to</span> <span m="2723130">structure discovery.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2725300">Now when is this stuff actually useful?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729560">Well, I hinted at a medical diagnosis, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2732600">That's a situation where you've got some symptoms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2734890">And you want to know what the disease is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2738160">So as soon as you use the keyword "diagnosis," you've</span> <span m="2742470">got a problem for which this stuff is a candidate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2745840">So what other kinds of diagnosis problems are there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2748640">Well, you might be lying to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2751360">So I can put a lie detector on you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2753350">And each of those variables that are measured by the lie</span> <span m="2755980">detector are an independent indication whether you're</span> <span m="2758370">telling the truth or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2759910">So it's this kind of Bayesian discovery thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2764300">Naive Bayesian Classification.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767410">What other kinds of problems speak to</span> <span m="2769972">the issue of diagnosis?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2771130">Well, we like to know how well you know the material!</span> </p>
<p><span m="2774410">So we can use quizzes as pieces of evidence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2779110">Thank god we don't use exactly a naive Bayesian classifier,</span> <span m="2781590">because then we wouldn't be able to do that combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784600">We have to use a slightly more complex--</span> <span m="2787020">what you can think of as a slightly more complex Bayesian</span> <span m="2790280">net to do that particular kind of diagnosis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793430">You might have a spacecraft or an airplane or other piece of</span> <span m="2796950">equipment with all sorts of symptoms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2798950">You're trying to figure out what to do next,</span> <span m="2800530">what the cause is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2802100">So using the evidence to go backward to the cause.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2806210">So maybe you've got some program that doesn't work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809470">Happens to me a lot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2811390">So I use the evidence from the symptoms of the misbehavior to</span> <span m="2814580">figure out what the most probable cause is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2818480">But now to conclude the day-- last time there weren't any</span> <span m="2823020">powerful ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2823890">But if you take the combination of the last</span> <span m="2828090">lecture and this lecture to be a candidate for gold star</span> <span m="2834170">ideas, these are the ones I'd like to leave you with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837740">We got here is--</span> <span m="2839750">this Bayesian stuff, all these probabilistic calculations are</span> <span m="2842420">the right thing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843965">They're the right way to work when you don't know anything,</span> <span m="2850270">which would make it sound like you're not very useful,</span> <span m="2852600">because you think you always-- well, in fact, there are a lot</span> <span m="2854890">of situations where you either can't know everything, don't</span> <span m="2858020">have time to know everything, or don't want to take the</span> <span m="2860420">effort to know everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2862630">So in medical diagnosis all you've got is the symptoms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2867190">You can't go in there and figure out in a more precise</span> <span m="2869730">way exactly what's wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2870750">So you use the symptoms to determine what the cause is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2873730">And then all those other kinds of cases that I mentioned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2876850">But now, what other kinds of structure discovery are there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2880520">Well, the kind of structure discovery that I hinted at in</span> <span m="2882760">the beginning will be the subject that we'll begin with</span> <span m="2885550">during our next and sadly final conversation here in</span> <span m="2890330">[? 10250 ?]</span> <span m="2891700">on Wednesday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2893320">It will feature not only a discussion of how this stuff</span> <span m="2896210">can be used to discover patterns and stories, but</span> <span m="2899890">we'll also talk about what's on the final, what kind of</span> <span m="2904590">thing you could do next, that sort of thing to finish off</span> <span m="2908870">the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2909420">And that's the end of the story for today.</span> </p>

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,970
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Ladies and gentlemen, the

2
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:13,670
engineers drinking song.

3
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,309
Back in the day, I've drunk
quite a lot to that song.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,420
And as drinking songs
go, it's not bad.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,260
I caution you, however, before
playing this song in the

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,240
presence of small children,
audition it first.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,460
Some of the verses are
sufficiently gross as to make

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,130
a sailor go beyond blushing.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,380
It's an interesting song because
there are an infinite

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,580
number of verses.

11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,840
Here's the mathematical proof.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,920
Suppose there were a finite
number of verses.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,080
Then there would be
a last verse.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,540
And if there were a last verse,
then some drunk alumni

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,570
would compose a new one.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,400
Therefore, there is no last
verse, the size is not finite,

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,430
and there are an infinite
number of verses.

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,610
I play it for you today because
I'm an engineer.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,336
I like to build stuff.

20
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:09,010
I build stuff out of wood.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,810
I build stuff out of metal.

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,830
I build stuff out of rocks.

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,470
And I especially like
to write programs.

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,180
I don't know, sometimes people
come to me and say, I'm

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,960
majoring in computer science,
but I don't

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,030
like to write programs.

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,470
I've always been mystified
by that.

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,900
I mean, if you want to show how
tough you are, you can go

29
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,430
bungee jumping or drive a nail
through your hand or something

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,680
like that instead.

31
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,750
But I've written quite a few
programs for demonstrating

32
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,650
stuff in this subject.

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,520
They're all written in Java,
principally because I can

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,660
therefore make them available to
you and to the rest of the

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,785
world by way of Web Start.

36
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:55,050
A few weeks ago, I was mucking
around with the system and

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,490
broke the version on the server,
and within 15 minutes,

38
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,490
I got an email from somebody
in the depths of Anatolia

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,960
complaining about it and asking
me to bring it back up.

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,699
This particular program
is patterned

41
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,830
after an early AI classic.

42
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,130
And it was the business end of
a program written by Terry

43
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,290
Winograd, who became, and is,
a professor of computer

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,220
science at Stanford
University--

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,940
which is on the west coast
for those of you--

46
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,510
on the strength of his work on
the natural language front end

47
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,100
of this program.

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,260
But the natural language part
is not what makes it of

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,079
interest for us today.

50
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,440
It's more the other
kinds of stuff.

51
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,550
Let's pile these things up.

52
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,320
Now, I'm going to ask to
do something, maybe put

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,970
B2 on top of B7.

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,840
Not bad.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,320
How about B6 on B3?

56
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,880
This program's kind of clever.

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,579
Let me do one more.

58
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,280
Let's put B7 on B2.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,510
OK, now let's see.

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,530
Maybe B5 on B2?

61
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,730
B4 on B3 first, maybe?

62
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,885
Oh, I must have clicked
the wrong button.

63
00:03:55,885 --> 00:03:56,675
Oh, there it goes.

64
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,780
OK.

65
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,716
Let's put B4 on B1.

66
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:08,190
Agh, my mouse keeps getting
out of control.

67
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,519
Now, let's put B1 on B2.

68
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,779
This is an example I'm
actually going to

69
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,029
work out on the board.

70
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, I see.

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,750
My touch pad accidentally
got activated.

72
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,440
B1 on B2.

73
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,800
Now, let's ask a question.

74
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,560
OK.

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,190
Well.

76
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,636
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

77
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,564
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Stop.

78
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:07,420
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

79
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,866
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Had enough of that.

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,550
Let's see.

81
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,460
Why did you put--

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,720
why did you want to
get rid of B4?

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,660
OK, one--

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,540
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

85
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,010
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Maybe
they think, that's what

86
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,575
happens when you use software
you write yourself.

87
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:51,662
Why did you want to clear
the top of B2?

88
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:55,050
Did I do that?

89
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,050
Why did you clear
the top of B1?

90
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,520
OK.

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,400
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,700
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

93
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,460
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, it's haunting me.

94
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,290
Yeah.

95
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,350
So the drinking song is easily
offended, I guess.

96
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,310
But I won't develop that
scenario again.

97
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,260
What I want to show you is that
this program looks like

98
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,430
it's kind of smart, and it
somehow can answer questions

99
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,230
about its own behavior.

100
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,800
Have you ever written a program
that's answered

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,020
questions about its
own behavior?

102
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,620
Probably not.

103
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,322
Would you like to learn
how to do that?

104
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,680
OK.

105
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,470
So by the end of the hour,
you'll be able to write this

106
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,400
program and many more like it
that know how to answer

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,040
questions about their
own behavior.

108
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,020
There have been tens of
thousands of such programs

109
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,175
written, but only by people who
know the stuff I'm going

110
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:03,080
to tell you about
right now, OK?

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,240
So what I want to do is I want
to start by taking this

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,500
program apart on the board and
talking to you about the

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,670
modules, the subroutines
that it contains.

114
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,070
So here it is.

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,280
The first thing we need
to think about,

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,530
here are some blocks.

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,500
What has to happen if I'm going
to put the bottom block

118
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,570
on the larger block?

119
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,680
Well, first of all, I have
to find space for it.

120
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,340
Then I have to grasp
the lower block.

121
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,380
And I have to move it and
I have to ungrasp it.

122
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,620
So those are four things I need
to do in order to achieve

123
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,140
what I want to do.

124
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:52,450
So therefore, I know that the
put-on method has four pieces.

125
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,480
It has to find space on
the target block.

126
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:05,500
It has to grasp the block that
it's been commanded to move.

127
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,580
Then it has to move, and
then it has to ungrasp.

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,680
But taking hints from some of
the questions that it did

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,350
answer before I got haunted by
the music, taking our cue from

130
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,850
that, we know that in order to
grasp something, in this

131
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,150
particular world, you can't have
anything on top of it.

132
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,929
So grasp, therefore, may call
clear top in order to get

133
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,710
stuff off from the
target object.

134
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,020
And that may happen in an
iterative loop because there

135
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,450
may be several things on top.

136
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,120
And how do you get
rid of stuff?

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,370
Well, by calling get rid of.

138
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,660
And that may go around
a loop several times.

139
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,210
And then, the way you get rid of
stuff is by calling put-on.

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,780
So that gives us recursion, and
it's from the recursion

141
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,110
that we get a lot of the
apparent complexity of the

142
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,920
program's behavior when
it solves a problem.

143
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,830
Now, in order to find space,
you also have to

144
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,070
call get rid of.

145
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,820
So that's where I meant to
put this other iterative

146
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,270
loop, not down here.

147
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,400
Cleat top has got the iterative
loop inside of it.

148
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,930
So that's the structure
of the program.

149
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,610
It's extremely simple.

150
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,810
And you might say to me, well,
how can you get such

151
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,140
apparently complex-looking
behavior out of

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,065
such a simple program?

153
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:36,665
A legitimate question.

154
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:41,090
But before we tackle that one
head on, I'd like to do a

155
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,870
simulation of this program
with a very

156
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,120
simple blocks problem.

157
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,380
And it's the one I almost
showed you, but

158
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,180
it goes like this.

159
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,786
Here's B1.

160
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:58,920
We'll call this BX because
I forgot its name.

161
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,250
Here's BY.

162
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,380
And here's B2.

163
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:12,080
And the task is to
put B1 on B2.

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,090
And according to our system
diagram, that results in four

165
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,410
calls to subroutines.

166
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,660
We have to find space.

167
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,995
We have to grasp B1.

168
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,630
We have to move, and
then we ungrasp.

169
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,260
Now, the way we grasp something
is the first thing

170
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,900
we have to do is clear
off its top.

171
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,640
So grasp calls clear top.

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,900
And clear top in turn
calls get rid of.

173
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,620
And let me see.

174
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,650
Let me keep track of these.

175
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,630
This is clearing the top
of B1, and this is

176
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,230
getting rid of BX.

177
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:34,685
And the way we get rid of BX is
by putting BX on the table.

178
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,800
And then that in turn causes
calls to another find space,

179
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,314
another grasp, another move,
and another ungrasp.

180
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,410
So that's a little trace of
the program as it works on

181
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,960
this simple problem.

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,440
So how does it go about
answering the questions that I

183
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,660
demonstrated to you
a moment ago?

184
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,340
Let's do that by using
this trace.

185
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,810
So how, for example, does it
answer the question, why did

186
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,060
you get rid of BX?

187
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,520
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

188
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,343
How can it answer
that question?

189
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:22,593
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]

190
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,480
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
it goes up one level and

191
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,590
reports what it sees.

192
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,800
So it says, and said in the
demonstration, I got rid of BX

193
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,660
because I was trying to
clear the top of B1.

194
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,325
So if I were to say why did you
clear the top of B1, it

195
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:47,015
would say because I was
trying to grasp it.

196
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:49,840
If I were to say, why did you
grasp B1, it would say because

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,990
I was putting B1 on B2.

198
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,120
If I say, why did you put
B1 on B2, it would say,

199
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,910
slavishly, because
you told me to.

200
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,770
OK, so that's how it deals
with why questions.

201
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,620
How about how questions?

202
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,680
Timothy, what do you think
about that one?

203
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,400
How would it go about answering
a question about how

204
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,650
you did something?

205
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,400
Do you have a thought?

206
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,428
TIMOTHY: Um, yeah, it would
think about what I was trying

207
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:21,750
to accomplish.

208
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,820
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, but

209
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,710
how would it do that?

210
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,550
How would the program do that?

211
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,150
We know that answering
a why question makes

212
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,710
it go up one level.

213
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,660
How does it answer
a how question?

214
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,800
Sebastian?

215
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,560
SEBASTIAN: It goes
down one level.

216
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,420
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
You go down one level.

217
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,210
So you start off all the way
up here with a put-on.

218
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,360
You will say, oh, well I
did these four things.

219
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,890
You say, why did you grasp B1?

220
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,170
It will say because I was
trying to clear its top.

221
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,960
Why did you clear its top?

222
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,930
Because I was trying
to get rid of it.

223
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,080
Why were you trying
to get rid of it?

224
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,890
Because I was trying to
put it on the table.

225
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,570
So that's how it answers how
questions, by going down in

226
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,280
this tree and this trace of the
program of action so as to

227
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,100
see how things are
put together.

228
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,940
What are these things that
are being put together?

229
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,460
What's the word I've been
avoiding so as to bring this

230
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,360
to a crescendo?

231
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,310
What are these objectives, these
things it wants to do?

232
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,530
They're goals.

233
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:25,780
So this thing is leaving a
trace, which is a goal tree.

234
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,260
Does that sound familiar?

235
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,400
Three days ago, we talked about
goal trees in connection

236
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,820
with integration.

237
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,440
So this thing is building a goal
tree, also known as an

238
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,320
and-or tree.

239
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,940
So this must be an and tree.

240
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,300
And if this is an and tree,
are there any and nodes?

241
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,590
Sure, there's one right there.

242
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,030
So do you think then that you
can answer questions about

243
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,740
your own behavior as long as
you build an and-or tree?

244
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,232
Sure.

245
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,880
Does this mean that the
integration program could

246
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,110
answer questions about
its own behavior?

247
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,990
Sure.

248
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,140
Because they both build goal
trees, and wherever you got a

249
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,270
goal tree, you can answer
certain kinds of questions

250
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,520
about your own behavior.

251
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:22,910
So let me see if in fact it
really does build itself a

252
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,660
goal tree as it solves
problems.

253
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,560
So this time, we'll put
B6 on B3 this time.

254
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,000
But watch it develop
its goal tree.

255
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,950
So in contrast to the simple
example I was working on the

256
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,726
board, this gets to be a pretty
complicated goal tree.

257
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,550
But I could still answers
questions about behavior.

258
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:59,430
For example, I could say, why
did you put B6 on B3?

259
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,790
Because you told me to.

260
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,090
All right, so the complexity of
the behavior is largely a

261
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,780
consequence not of the
complexity of the program in

262
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,230
this particular case, but the
building of this giant goal

263
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,880
tree as a consequence of the
complexity of the problem.

264
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,400
This brings us to one of
our previous matters--

265
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,130
early on to one of the gold
star ideas of today.

266
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:29,080
And this gold star idea goes
back to a lecture given in the

267
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,470
late '60s by Herb Simon, who was
the first Nobel Laureate

268
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,030
in the pseudo Nobel Prize
for economics.

269
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,690
Is that right, Bob?

270
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,390
Was he the first?

271
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,810
All right, he was the first
winner of the Nobel Prize,

272
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,800
pseudo Nobel Prize
in economics.

273
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,170
And in this lecture, which was
titled "The Sciences of the

274
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,500
Artificial," he said imagine
that you're looking on a beach

275
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,705
at the path of a ant.

276
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,580
And he said, well, you know,
the path of the ant looks

277
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,070
extremely complicated.

278
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,640
And you're tempted to think the
ant is some kind of genius

279
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,670
or monster brain ant.

280
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,780
But in fact, when you take a
closer look, what you discover

281
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,490
is that there are a bunch of
pebbles on the beach, and all

282
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:19,608
the ant is doing is avoiding
those pebbles on his way home.

283
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:23,450
So the complexity of the
behavior, said Simon, is a

284
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,900
consequence of the complexity
of the environment, not the

285
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
complexity of the program.

286
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,620
So that's the metaphoric
Simon's ant.

287
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:39,910
And what it says is that the
complexity of the behavior is

288
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:50,270
the max of the complexity of the
program and the complexity

289
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,520
of the environment.

290
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
So that's something we'll see
many times during the rest of

291
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,830
the semester.

292
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,000
Complex behavior,
simple program.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,105
You think it's going
to be complicated.

294
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:09,130
It turns out to be simple
because the problem has the

295
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,810
complexity, not the program.

296
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,350
So that brings us to check box
three in today's talk, and

297
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,520
there's a little bit of a scene
here because now I want

298
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,140
to stop talking about
goal-centered programming and

299
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,840
start talking about rule-based
expert systems.

300
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,190
The rule-based expert systems
were developed in a burst of

301
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,870
enthusiasm about the prospects
for commercial applications of

302
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:45,530
artificial intelligence
in the mid-1980s.

303
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,010
At that time, it was supposed
lengthy articles are written,

304
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,620
but you could account for
useful aspects of human

305
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,980
intelligence by writing all the
knowledge in the form of

306
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,870
simple rules.

307
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,700
So if this is true,
then that's true.

308
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,070
If you want to achieve
this, then do that.

309
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,690
But all the knowledge had to be
encapsulated in the form of

310
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,440
simple rules.

311
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,780
So what might you want
to do with this?

312
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,110
All sorts of things.

313
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,510
Thousands of these systems
were written,

314
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,760
as I indicated before.

315
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,890
But here's an example.

316
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,790
I'm going to work out an example
having to do with

317
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,870
identification.

318
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,980
And this example is patterned
off of a classic program,

319
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,885
strangely also written at
Stanford, called MYCIN.

320
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:34,210
It was developed to
diagnose bacterial

321
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,470
infections in the blood.

322
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,140
So you come in.

323
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,800
You got some horrible disease,
and the doctor gets curious

324
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,880
about what antibiotic would be
perfect for your disease.

325
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,500
He starts asking a
lot of questions.

326
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,710
So I'm not going to deal with
that because that world has

327
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,250
all kinds of unpronounceable
terms like bacterioides and

328
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,310
anaerobic and stuff like that.

329
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,770
So it's completely analogous
to talk about identifying

330
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:12,210
animals in a little zoo, sort
of a small town type of zoo.

331
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,320
So I'm going to suggest that
we write down on a piece of

332
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,710
paper all the things we can
observe about an animal, and

333
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,210
then we'll try to figure
out what the animal is.

334
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,610
So I don't know, what
can we start with?

335
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,860
Has hair.

336
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,660
Then there are some
characteristics of the

337
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,080
following form.

338
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,330
Has claws.

339
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,840
Sharp teeth.

340
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,060
And forward-pointing eyes.

341
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,120
And these are all
characteristics of carnivores.

342
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,190
We happen to have
forward-pointing eyes too, but

343
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,560
that's more because we used to
swing around the trees a lot,

344
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,420
and we needed the
stereo vision.

345
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,530
And we don't have the claws
and the sharp teeth

346
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,400
that go with it.

347
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,030
But anyhow, those are typically
characteristics of

348
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,040
carnivores, as is eating meat.

349
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,090
And this particular little
animal we're looking at has

350
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,435
also got spots, and
it's very fast.

351
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,550
What is it?

352
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,480
Well, everybody says
it's a cheetah.

353
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,970
Let's see how our program
would figure that out.

354
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,210
Well, program might say, let's
see if it has hair, then rule

355
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,985
one says that that means
it must be a mammal.

356
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,450
We can imagine another rule that
says if you have sharp

357
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,410
claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, then

358
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,750
you're a carnivore.

359
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,670
And I'm using sort of hardware
notation here.

360
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,940
That's an and gate, right?

361
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,040
So that means we have to have
all of these characteristics

362
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,170
before we will conclude that
the animal is a carnivore.

363
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,870
Now, this animal has been also
observed to eat meat.

364
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,750
So that means we've got extra
evidence that the animal is

365
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,700
carnivorous.

366
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:52,020
And now, because the animal is
a mammal and a carnivore and

367
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,700
has spots, and it's very fast,
then the animal is a cheetah.

368
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:07,850
And I hope all of our African
students agree that

369
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,000
it must be a cheetah.

370
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,980
It's a small zoo--

371
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,420
I mean, a big zoo.

372
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,830
Who knows what it is?

373
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,700
It's probably got some
unpronouncable name--

374
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,990
there's possibilities.

375
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,010
But for our small zoo,
that will do.

376
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,260
So we have group now written
down in the form

377
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,270
of these and gates.

378
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,030
Several rules, R1, R2--
and there needs to

379
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,040
be an and gate here--

380
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,665
that's R3 and an R4.

381
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,500
All of which indicate that
this animal is a cheetah.

382
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,155
So we built ourself a little
rule-based expert system that

383
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,400
can recognize exactly one
animal, but you could imagine

384
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,540
filling out this system with
other rules so that you could

385
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,750
recognize giraffes and penguins
and all the other

386
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,590
sorts of things you find
in a small zoo.

387
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,920
So when you have a system like
this that works as I've

388
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,236
indicated, then what we're
going to call that, we're

389
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:04,660
going to give that a special
name, and we're going to call

390
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:16,560
that a forward-chaining
rule-based--

391
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,810
because it uses rules--

392
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,403
expert system.

393
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,050
And we're going to put expert
in parentheses because when

394
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,280
these things were developed,
for marketing reasons, they

395
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,470
called them expert systems
instead of novice systems.

396
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,490
But are they really experts
in a human sense?

397
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,880
Not really, because they have
these knee-jerk rules.

398
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,500
They're not equipped with
anything you might want to

399
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,800
call common sense.

400
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,700
They don't have an ability to
deal with previous cases, like

401
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,940
we do when we go to
medical school.

402
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,170
So they really ought to be
called rule-based novice

403
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,120
systems because they reason
like novices on

404
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,170
the basis of rules.

405
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,585
But the tradition
is to call them

406
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:11,590
rule-based expert systems.

407
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:18,310
And this one works forward from
the facts we give it to

408
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,260
the conclusion off
on the right.

409
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,350
That's why it's a
forward-chaining system.

410
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,420
Can this system answer
questions

411
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,670
about its own behavior?

412
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:36,160
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

413
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,900
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].

414
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,010
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Why?

415
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,986
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].

416
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:41,730
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Because it

417
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,466
looks like a goal tree.

418
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:44,960
Right.

419
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,130
This is, in fact, building a
goal tree because each of

420
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:55,000
these rules that require several
things to be true is

421
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,920
creating an and node.

422
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,180
And each of these situations
here where you have multiple

423
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,190
reasons for believing that the
thing is a carnivore, that's

424
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,960
creating an or node.

425
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,820
And we already know that you
can answer questions about

426
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,440
your own behavior if you leave
behind a trace of a goal tree.

427
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,620
So look at this.

428
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:20,260
If I say to it, why were
you interested in

429
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,520
the animal's claws?

430
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,020
Because I was trying to see
if it was a carnivore.

431
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,710
How did you know that the
animal is a mammal?

432
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,190
Because it has hair.

433
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,450
Why did you think it
was a cheetah?

434
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,190
Because it's a mammal,
a carnivore, has

435
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,010
spots, and very fast.

436
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,570
So by working forward and
backward in this goal tree,

437
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,990
this too can answer questions
about its own behavior.

438
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,020
So now you know how, going
forward, you can write

439
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,900
programs that answer questions
about their behavior.

440
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,950
Either you write the subroutines
so that each one

441
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,710
is wrapped around a goal, so
you've got goal-centered

442
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,420
programming, or you build a
so-called expert system using

443
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,010
rules, in which case it's easy
to make it leave behind a

444
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,180
trace of a goal tree, which
makes it possible to answer

445
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,670
questions about its own
behavior, just as this

446
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,170
[INAUDIBLE]

447
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,420
program did.

448
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:16,330
But now, a little
more vocabulary.

449
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,260
I'm going to save time by
erasing all of these things

450
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,210
that I previously drew by
way of connections.

451
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:33,610
And I'm going to approach this
zoo in a little different way.

452
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:39,360
I'm going to not ask any
questions about the animal.

453
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,510
Instead, I'm going to say,
mommy, is this thing I'm

454
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,220
looking at a cheetah?

455
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,640
And how would mommy go about
figuring it out.

456
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,330
In her head, she would say,
well, I don't know.

457
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,425
If it's going to be a cheetah,
then it must be the case that

458
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:05,010
it's a carnivore, and it must be
the case that it has spots.

459
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,350
And it must be the case
that it's very fast.

460
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,210
So so far, what we've
established is that if it's

461
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,940
going to be a cheetah, it
has to have the four

462
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,880
characteristics that
mommy finds behind

463
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,440
this rule are four.

464
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,710
So instead of working forward
from facts, what I'm going to

465
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:31,460
do is work backward
from a hypothesis.

466
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,720
So here the hypothesis is
this thing is a cheetah.

467
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,110
How do I go about showing
whether that's true or not?

468
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,250
Well, I haven't done anything so
far because all I know is a

469
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,740
cheetah if all these things are
true, but are they true?

470
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,160
Well, to find out if it's a
mammal, I can use rule one.

471
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,270
And if I know or can determine
that the animal has hair, then

472
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,790
that part of it is
taken care of.

473
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:01,990
And I can similarly work my way
back through carnivore.

474
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,870
I say, well, it's a carnivore if
it has claws, sharp teeth,

475
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,680
and forward-pointing eyes.

476
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,860
And then as much as the
animal in question

477
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,720
does, then I'm through.

478
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,555
I know it's a carnivore.

479
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,980
I don't have to go through and
show that it's a carnivore

480
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,230
another way.

481
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,400
So I never actually ask
questions about

482
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,600
whether it eats meat.

483
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,720
Finally, the final two
conditions are met by just an

484
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,020
inspection of the animal.

485
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,300
That's to say, it's
in the database.

486
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,400
I don't have to use any rules
to determine that the animal

487
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,290
has spots and is very fast.

488
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,610
So now, I've got everything in
place to say that it's a

489
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,490
cheetah, because it's a
carnivore, because it has

490
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,330
claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, and all

491
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,980
the rest of this stuff is
similarly determined by going

492
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,170
backwards, backwards from the
hypothesis toward the facts,

493
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,730
instead of from the facts
forward to the conclusions.

494
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:09,180
So building a system that works
like that, I have a

495
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:15,980
backward-chaining rule-based
expert system.

496
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,040
But there's a very important
characteristic of this system

497
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,620
in both backward and forward
mode, and that is that this

498
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,400
thing is a deduction system.

499
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,760
That's because it's
working with facts

500
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,750
to produce new facts.

501
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,730
When you have a deduction
system, you can never take

502
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,920
anything away.

503
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,790
But these rule-based systems are
also used in another mode,

504
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,530
where it's possible to
take something away.

505
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,110
See, in fact world, in deduction
world, you're

506
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,920
talking about proving things.

507
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,320
And once you prove something
is true, it can't be false.

508
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,100
If it is, you've got a
contradiction in your system.

509
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,340
But if you think of this as a
programming language, if you

510
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,510
think of using rules as a
programming language, then you

511
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:04,770
can think of arranging it so
these rules add or subtract

512
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,380
from the database.

513
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,500
Let me show you an example
of a couple of systems.

514
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,650
First of all, since I've talked
about the MYCIN system,

515
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:41,910
let me show you an example
of a MYCIN dialogue.

516
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,750
That's a MYCIN dialogue.

517
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,320
And you can see the appearance
of words you have to go to

518
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,570
medical school to learn.

519
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,830
And here's a typical MYCIN rule,
just like the rules for

520
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,252
doing zoo analysis, only a
more complicated domain.

521
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:01,130
But here's another example of a
system that was written, not

522
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,300
in the '80s, but just a couple
of years ago by a student in

523
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,340
the architecture department,
Ph.D. thesis.

524
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,150
He was interested in the
architecture of a Portuguese

525
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,250
architect named Siza.

526
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,180
And Siza's done a lot of
mass housing stuff.

527
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,570
And Siza has the idea that you
ought to be able to design

528
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,500
your own house.

529
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,240
And so Jose Duarte, a Portuguese
student, a Ph.D.

530
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,260
student in architecture, wrote
a rule-based system that was

531
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,950
capable of designing Siza-like
houses in response to the

532
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,080
requirements and recommendations
and desires of

533
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,740
the people who are going
to occupy the houses.

534
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,150
So the most compelling part of
this thing, of this exercise,

535
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:51,780
was that Duarte took some of
the designs of the program,

536
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,330
mixed them up with some of the
designs of Siza, and put them

537
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,840
in front of Siza, and said,
which ones did you do?

538
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,550
And Siza couldn't tell.

539
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,600
So somehow, the rule-based
system that was built using

540
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,530
this kind of technology was
sufficient to confuse even the

541
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,040
expert that they were
patterned after.

542
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,555
But this program is a
little complicated.

543
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:17,710
It, too, has its own
specialized lingo.

544
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,460
So I'm not going to talk about
it in detail, but rather talk

545
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,320
instead about an analogous
problem.

546
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,910
And that is a problem that
everyone has faced at one

547
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,210
point or another, and that
is the problem of putting

548
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,952
groceries in a bag at
a grocery store.

549
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:37,110
It's the same thing, right?

550
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,770
Instead of putting rooms in
a house, you're putting

551
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,660
groceries in a bag.

552
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,640
And there must be some rules
about how to do that.

553
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,910
In fact, maybe some of you have
been professional grocery

554
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,420
store baggers?

555
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,870
[INAUDIBLE] a grocery store
professional bagger.

556
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,760
You're a--

557
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,480
which one?

558
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,850
LISA: [INAUDIBLE]

559
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,475
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, what is your name?

560
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:01,770
LISA: Lisa.

561
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,120
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Lisa.

562
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,640
OK, well we got two
professional

563
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,730
grocery store baggers.

564
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,429
And I'm going to be now
simulating a highly paid

565
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,800
knowledge engineer desirous of
building a program that knows

566
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,300
how to bag groceries.

567
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:22,300
So I'm going to visit your site,
Market Basket, and I'm

568
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,889
going to ask Lisa, now fearful
of losing her job, if she

569
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,250
would tell me about how
she bags groceries.

570
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,780
So could you suggest a rule?

571
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,226
LISA: Sure.

572
00:34:34,226 --> 00:34:36,154
Large items in the bottom.

573
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:37,600
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Large
items in the bottom.

574
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,350
You see, that's why I'm a
highly paid knowledge

575
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,090
engineer, because I translate
what she said

576
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,090
into an if-then rule.

577
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,300
So if large, then bottom.

578
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,370
So now I--

579
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,030
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

580
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,020
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
how about you, [INAUDIBLE]?

581
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,270
Have you got a suggestion?

582
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,355
About how to bag groceries?

583
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:59,840
SPEAKER 6: The small
things on top.

584
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,180
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
If small, then on top.

585
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,690
Lisa, have you got anything
else you could tell me?

586
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,070
LISA: Don't put too many heavy
things in the same bag.

587
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,500
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Don't put too many heavy

588
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,750
things in the same bag.

589
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,330
So if heavy greater than
three, then new bag, or

590
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,560
something like that.

591
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,615
Is that all we're going to be
able to-- does anybody else

592
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,430
want to volunteer?

593
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,677
[INAUDIBLE], have you bagged
groceries in Turkey?

594
00:35:20,677 --> 00:35:22,665
LISA: So they don't
have grocery

595
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:26,144
baggers, so we have to--

596
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:27,635
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
everybody's a professional

597
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:28,640
bagger in Turkey.

598
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:28,915
Yeah.

599
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:30,165
It's outsourced to
the customers.

600
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,694
SPEAKER 7: So no squishies
on the bottom.

601
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:35,642
So if you have--

602
00:35:35,642 --> 00:35:36,590
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: No
squishies on the bottom.

603
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,064
SPEAKER 7: If you
have tomatoes--

604
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,050
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
That's good.

605
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:38,400
Tomatoes.

606
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,260
SPEAKER 7: You don't want
them to get squished.

607
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,880
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Now,
there's a very different

608
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,070
thing about squishies and
tomatoes because tomato is

609
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,395
specific, and squishy isn't.

610
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,090
Now, one tendency of MIT
students, of course, is that

611
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:52,270
we all tend to generalize.

612
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,190
I once knew a professor
in the Sloan School

613
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,270
who seemed real smart.

614
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,240
And--

615
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,150
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

616
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,410
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Then I

617
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,270
figured out what he did.

618
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,250
If I were to say, I'm thinking
about a red apple.

619
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,720
They'd sit back and say, oh,
I see you're contemplating

620
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,330
colored fruit today.

621
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:16,740
They're just taking it up one
level of abstraction.

622
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,530
Not a genius.

623
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,320
He also was able to talk for
an hour after he drew a

624
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,460
triangle on the board.

625
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,520
Amazing people.

626
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,160
Anyhow, where were we?

627
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,690
Oh, yes, bagging groceries.

628
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,690
So we're making some progress,
but not as

629
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,950
much as I would like.

630
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,800
And so in order to really make
progress on tasks like this,

631
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,790
you have to exercise--

632
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,040
you know about some principles
of knowledge engineering.

633
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,310
So principle number one, which
I've listed over here as part

634
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,950
of a gold star idea, is deal
with specific cases.

635
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:55,870
So while you're at the site, if
all you do is talk to the

636
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:59,210
experts like Lisa and
[INAUDIBLE], all you're going

637
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,490
to get is vague generalities
because they won't think of

638
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,260
everything.

639
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,620
So what you do is you
say, well, let me

640
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,870
watch you on the line.

641
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,810
And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of

642
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,540
dealing with the milk.

643
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,220
And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of

644
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,600
dealing with the potato chips.

645
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,150
Nobody mentioned potato chips,
except insofar as they might

646
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,400
be squishy.

647
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,520
We don't have a definition
for squishy.

648
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,840
Nobody talked about
the macaroni.

649
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,790
And no one talked about
the motor oil.

650
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,050
This is a convenience store.

651
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,240
I don't want that in the
same bag with the meat.

652
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,890
And then no one talked
about canned stuff.

653
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,450
Here's a can of olives.

654
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,930
So by looking at specific cases,
you elicit from people

655
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,620
knowledge they otherwise would
not have thought to give you.

656
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,450
That's knowledge engineering
rule number one.

657
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,310
And within a very few minutes,
you'll have all three

658
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,480
knowledge engineering rules and
be prepared to be a highly

659
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,730
paid knowledge engineer.

660
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,350
Heuristic, let's call
these heuristics.

661
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,120
Heuristic number one,
specific cases.

662
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,100
Heuristic number two is ask
questions about things that

663
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,070
appear to be the same, but are
actually handled differently.

664
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:20,888
So there's some Birds Eye
frozen peas, and here--

665
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:27,160
ugh, some fresh cut
sweet peas.

666
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:31,540
And to me, the person who's
never touched a grocery bag in

667
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,900
my life-- maybe I'm
from Mars--

668
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,990
I can't tell the difference.

669
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,910
They're both peas.

670
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,980
But I observe that the experts
are handling these objects

671
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,650
differently.

672
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,940
So I say, why did you handle
those peas differently from

673
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,250
those peas, and what
do they say?

674
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,410
One's canned, and
one's frozen.

675
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,150
So what happens?

676
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,280
Bingo, I've got some new
words in my vocabulary.

677
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,660
And those new vocabulary words
are going to give me power

678
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,570
over the domain because
I can now use

679
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,380
those words in my rules.

680
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,540
And I can write rules like if
frozen, then put them all

681
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,910
together in a little
plastic bag.

682
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,660
Actually, that's too
complicated, but that's what

683
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,000
we end up doing, right?

684
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,720
Why do we put them
all together in a

685
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,141
little plastic bag?

686
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:18,105
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]

687
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,087
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?

688
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:20,070
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]

689
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:20,690
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Well, there are two

690
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,940
explanations.

691
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,750
There's the MIT explanation.

692
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,120
We know that temperature flow
is equal to the fourth power

693
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,400
of the temperature difference
and the surface area and all

694
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,130
that kind of stuff.

695
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:39,500
We want to get them all together
in a ball, sphere.

696
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,660
The normal explanation is that
they're going to melt anyway,

697
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,808
so they might as well not
get everything else wet.

698
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:44,784
All right.

699
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:50,640
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

700
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,760
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
that's heuristic number two.

701
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,140
And actually, there's heuristic
number three, that I

702
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,860
just want to relate to you for
the first time because I have

703
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,770
been dealing with it a lot
over this past summer.

704
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,160
Heuristic number three is you
build a system, and you see

705
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,820
when it cracks.

706
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,770
And when it cracks is when you
don't have one of the rules

707
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,130
you need in order to execute--

708
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,180
in order to get the program
to execute as

709
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,890
you want it to execute.

710
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,730
So if I were to write a grocery
store bagging program

711
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:20,290
and have it bag some groceries,
again, eventually

712
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:22,680
it would either make a mistake
or come to a grinding halt,

713
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,350
and bingo, I know that there's
a missing rule.

714
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,090
Isn't that what happens when you
do a problem set, and you

715
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:34,360
hit an impasse?

716
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,920
You're performing an experiment
on yourself, and

717
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,560
you're discovering that you
don't have the whole program.

718
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,140
In fact, I've listed this as a
gold star idea having to do

719
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,460
with engineering yourself
because all of these things

720
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,400
that you can do for knowledge
engineering are things you can

721
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,170
do when you learn a new
subject yourself.

722
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,730
Because essentially, you're
making yourself into an expert

723
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,940
system when you're learning
circuit theory or

724
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,230
electromagnetism or something
of that sort.

725
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,420
You're saying to yourself,
well, let's look at some

726
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,310
specific cases.

727
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,870
Well, what are the vocabulary
items here that tell me why

728
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,450
this problem is different
from that problem?

729
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,380
Oh, this is a cylinder
instead of a sphere.

730
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,200
Or you're working with a problem
set, and you discover

731
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
you can't work with the problem,
and you need to get

732
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,860
another chunk of knowledge
that makes it possible

733
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,600
for you to do it.

734
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,260
So this sort of thing, which
you think of primarily as a

735
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,400
mechanism, heuristics for doing
knowledge engineering,

736
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,515
are also mechanisms for making
yourself smarter.

737
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,990
So that concludes what I want to
talk with you about today.

738
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,320
But the bottom line is, that
if you build a rule-based

739
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,880
expert system, it can
answer questions

740
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,540
about its own behavior.

741
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,850
If you build a program that's
centered on goals, it can

742
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,815
answer questions about
its own behavior.

743
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:54,190
If you build an integration
program, it can answer

744
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,120
questions about its
own behavior.

745
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,950
And if you want to build one of
these systems, and you need

746
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,760
to extract knowledge from an
expert, you need to approach

747
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,610
it with these kinds of
heuristics because the expert

748
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,320
won't think what to tell you
unless you elicit that

749
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,680
information by specific cases,
by asking questions about

750
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,760
differences, and by ultimately
doing some experiments to see

751
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,850
where your program is correct.

752
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:19,960
So that really concludes what I
had to say, except I want to

753
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,080
ask the question, is this all
we need to know about human

754
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,010
intelligence?

755
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,260
Can these things be--

756
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,500
are these things really smart?

757
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,890
And the traditional answer is
no, they're not really smart

758
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,610
because their intelligence is
this sort of thin veneer.

759
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,090
And when you try to get
underneath it, as written,

760
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,160
they tend to crack.

761
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,030
For example, we talk about a
rule, we could talk about a

762
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,290
rule that knows that you should
put the potato chips on

763
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,540
the top of the bag.

764
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,375
But a program that knows that
would have no idea why you

765
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:03,660
would want to put the potato
chips on top of the bag.

766
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,610
They wouldn't know that if you
put them on the bottom of the

767
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,870
bag, they'll get crushed.

768
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,310
And it wouldn't know that if
they get crushed, the customer

769
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,630
will get angry, because people
don't like to eat crushed

770
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,340
potato chips.

771
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,280
So that's what I mean when I
say the knowledge of these

772
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,790
things tends to be a veneer.

773
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,000
So the MYCIN program, during
debugging, once prescribed a

774
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,595
barrel of penicillin to be
administered to a patient for

775
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:34,340
its disease.

776
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,510
They don't know, they don't
have any common sense.

777
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,620
So the question then becomes,
well, I don't know.

778
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,460
Does rule-based--

779
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,550
do rules have anything to
do with common sense?

780
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,340
And I'm becoming a little bit
agnostic on that subject.

781
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,440
Because there are certain
indications, there are certain

782
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,600
situations, in which rules could
be said to play a role

783
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,495
in our ordinary understanding
of things.

784
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,560
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

785
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,060
What I'm going to show you,
when the clip speaks up--

786
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,640
well, before I make any
promises, let me see if I'm

787
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,910
actually connected to the web.

788
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,770
MIT, good.

789
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,820
MIT.

790
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,700
Guest.

791
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,950
Yeah, that's me.

792
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,070
Sounds good.

793
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,650
OK, I just tested the system,
and I've seen it is actually

794
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,330
connected to the web.

795
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,230
And I'm going to adjust some
systems options here.

796
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,120
I'll get rid of the text box.

797
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,160
And we'll get rid of those
changes scale a little bit.

798
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,780
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to read a little

799
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,050
synopsis of the Macbeth plot.

800
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,190
You're MIT students.

801
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:46,920
I'm sure you're all classically
educated and very

802
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,830
familiar with Shakespearean
plots.

803
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,980
So I'm going to read one.

804
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,330
I'm going to read a version
of a Macbeth plot.

805
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,260
And it's going to go
along like this.

806
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,040
It's basically reading
a rule base so far.

807
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,910
And pretty soon, it's going to
get beyond the rule base and

808
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,435
start reading the
Macbeth story.

809
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,740
And there it is.

810
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,720
It's read the Macbeth story.

811
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,860
Let me show you what the Macbeth
story looks like as

812
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,660
it's actually retained
by the system.

813
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,320
That's it.

814
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,570
Read that.

815
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,310
OK, you ran out of
time because the

816
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,490
machine's already finished.

817
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,830
It takes about five seconds
to read this story.

818
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,920
Now, as you look at this little
synopsis of Macbeth,

819
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,510
there are a couple
things to note.

820
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:39,090
For one thing, it says that
Duncan is murdered.

821
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,650
Duncan, I hope this doesn't
bother you.

822
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,530
Duncan is murdered by Macbeth.

823
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,205
But at no time does it say
that Duncan is dead.

824
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,800
But you know Duncan's dead
because he was murdered.

825
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,168
If murdered, then dead.

826
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:55,000
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].

827
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,640
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
if you look a little further

828
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,890
down, what you see is that
Macduff kills Macbeth.

829
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,260
Fourth line up from
the bottom.

830
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,410
Why did Macduff kill Macbeth?

831
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,630
Doesn't say why in this story,
but you have no trouble

832
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,950
figuring out that it's
because he got angry.

833
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,970
And when you get angry, you
don't necessarily kill

834
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,300
somebody, but it's possible.

835
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,190
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].

836
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,240
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
now that you see what's in the

837
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,550
story, let me take you
back to this display.

838
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:31,210
It's what we call an
elaboration graph.

839
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,360
And when I blow it up, you can
see that there's some familiar

840
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,340
looking things in there.

841
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,630
For example, up here in the
left-hand corner, Macbeth

842
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,700
murders Duncan, right
over there.

843
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,510
And over here, Macduff
kills Macbeth.

844
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:50,710
And if you look at what is a
consequence of that, it looks

845
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,010
like there must be a rule that
says if you murder somebody,

846
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,670
you harm them.

847
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:58,540
And if you murder somebody,
then they're dead.

848
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,270
And one reason why you might
kill somebody is because they

849
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,500
angered you.

850
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,880
And if you go the other way,
one consequence of killing

851
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,160
somebody is that you harm them,
and that they die too.

852
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,120
And if you harm somebody, they
get angry, and their state

853
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,370
goes negative.

854
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,550
So that suggests that there are
some things that we have

855
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,145
on our hands that are very
compiled and very, strangely

856
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:30,970
enough, very rule-like
in their character.

857
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,730
Now, to close, I'm just
going to read Hamlet.

858
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,900
The Hamlet demonstration is
much like the Macbeth one.

859
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,270
In fact, Hamlet and Macbeth are
very alike in their plot.

860
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,530
But there's one thing that's
well-illustrated by our

861
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,940
particular capturing
of Hamlet here.

862
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,910
And that is that you'll note
that the ratio of gray stuff

863
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,060
to white stuff is
considerable.

864
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,810
The gray stuff is stuff that
has been deduced by rules.

865
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,140
And the reason there's so much
gray stuff in this Hamlet

866
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,380
story is because everybody's
related to everybody else.

867
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,920
So when you kill anybody, you
irritate everybody else.

868
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,750
So look at that.

869
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,310
A few white things, those are
the things that are explicit

870
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:18,630
in the story, and lots
of gray stuff.

871
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,270
So what this is suggesting is
that when we tell a story,

872
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,440
it's mostly a matter of
controlled hallucination.

873
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,560
I know what rules are in your
head, so I could take

874
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,030
advantage of that in telling the
story and not have to tell

875
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,490
you anything I'm sure you're
going to know.

876
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,640
And so that's why, we've
discovered, that storytelling

877
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,500
is largely a matter of just
controlling how you're going

878
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,010
along, a kind of controlled
hallucination.

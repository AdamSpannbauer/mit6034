<p><span m="9290">PATRICK WINSTON: Well, don't stop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="10590">Shoot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="12710">I guess we've got to stop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="15280">I will soon go into withdrawal symptoms that will</span> <span m="17310">last about six weeks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="19890">But, on the other hand, we all are beginning to develop a</span> <span m="22570">sort of tired and desperate look.</span> </p>
<p><span m="25270">And perhaps it's a good thing to get the semester behind us</span> <span m="29500">and go into solstice hibernation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="32311">Anyway, there's a lot to do today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="34250">I want to wrap up a couple things, talk about what's</span> <span m="36490">next, and maybe get into some big issues, perhaps a little</span> <span m="39720">Genesis demo, that sort of thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="41990">So here's what we're going to do first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="44150">Last time, I talked about this whole idea</span> <span m="46730">of structure discovery.</span> </p>
<p><span m="48440">And really, the whole reason I cracked and started talking</span> <span m="51180">about basic methods is because of the potential utility of</span> <span m="55620">taking that idea one step further and finding structure</span> <span m="58790">in situations where you might not otherwise find it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="63170">It's still an open question about whether that's best way</span> <span m="65060">to think about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="65740">But here it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69690">Imagine you've got a couple of stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="72039">And these circles represent the events in the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="75630">And now what you'd like to get out of these stories is some</span> <span m="78320">kind of finite state graph that describes the collection</span> <span m="84080">of stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="85760">So you might discover, for example, that these two events</span> <span m="90350">are quite similar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="92200">And these two events are quite similar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="95940">So you might use that as a basis for speculating that</span> <span m="99420">maybe a more compact way of representing the stuff in the</span> <span m="104080">story would look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="109020">Where this one--</span> <span m="112690">let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="113030">This one goes with this one, this one goes with this one</span> <span m="117800">and there's a possibility of another state in between.</span> </p>
<p><span m="121090">So that's the notion of Bayesian story merging.</span> </p>
<p><span m="125090">Now I'd like to show you a little bit more convincing</span> <span m="126810">demonstration of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="128830">Here's how it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="136765">So there are the two stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="138290">This is just a classroom demonstration, no big deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="141406">But you can see there's a sort of parallel</span> <span m="143530">structure in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145520">So this is the work of a graduate student, Mark</span> <span m="147995">Finlayson, who processed those stories to produce those kinds</span> <span m="153050">of events and those kinds of events that get assembled into</span> <span m="156790">two story graphs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="159600">And the question is, is the most probable way of</span> <span m="163370">explaining that corpus of stories?</span> </p>
<p><span m="165640">And of course, the answer is no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="168140">If you merge some things like chase and stop, then you get a</span> <span m="175680">simpler graph, one that is more probable in the same</span> <span m="178980">sense that we discussed last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="181290">Then you can merge run and flee because they're similar</span> <span m="183860">kinds of events.</span> </p>
<p><span m="185880">And finally, you've got think and decide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="188460">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="189980">There is your story graph.</span> </p>
<p><span m="193310">And this is the same idea taken several levels higher</span> <span m="196590">that produce the capacity to discover, in these two</span> <span m="199180">stories, the concept of revenge, as promised at the</span> <span m="203180">beginning of our last discussion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="206860">So sometimes the Bayesian stuff is the right thing to</span> <span m="209630">do, especially if you don't know anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="211960">But sometimes you do know stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="214370">And when you do know stuff it's possible that you can do</span> <span m="217320">something very much more efficient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="219560">This sort of thing takes clouds of</span> <span m="222200">computers to process.</span> </p>
<p><span m="225130">But we learned a lot of stuff in the course of our</span> <span m="227670">development that we don't use a cloud of</span> <span m="229670">computers to figure out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="232650">We learned how to associate the gestures of our mouth with</span> <span m="239250">the sounds that we make, for example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="242160">So I want to spend a minute or two talking about some work</span> <span m="245200">that someday will be the subject of a couple of</span> <span m="248790">lectures, I think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="250586">But it's the question of how to use multiple modalities and</span> <span m="258250">correspondences between them to sort out both of the</span> <span m="263720">contributing modalities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="265820">That sounds contradictory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="266910">Let me show you an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="271940">This is the example, a zebra finch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="273780">And it's showing you the result of a program written by</span> <span m="279090">Michael Coen, now a professor at the</span> <span m="280700">University of Wisconsin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="283409">So the male zebra finch learns to sing a nice mating song</span> <span m="289420">from its daddy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="291159">And this is what one such zebra finch sounds like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="294240">[BIRD SONG PLAYING]</span> <span m="296690">Nice, don't you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="299100">And here's what was learned by a program that uses no</span> <span m="302620">probabilistic stuff at all, but rather the notion of</span> <span m="305150">cross-modal coupling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="307528">[BIRD SONG PLAYING]</span> <span m="309472">Can you tell the difference?</span> </p>
<p><span m="312700">It's not known if this particular song turns on the</span> <span m="315970">female zebra finch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="317775">But to the untrained human ear, they sure</span> <span m="321750">sound a whole lot alike.</span> </p>
<p><span m="324550">So how does that work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="326170">Here's how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="332720">Well, I'm not going to show you how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334280">What I'm going to show you is how the classroom example</span> <span m="337350">works, the first chapter example in</span> <span m="339780">Coen's Ph.D. Thesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="341930">Here's what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="343070">When we talk, we produce a Fourier transform that moves</span> <span m="346740">along with our speech.</span> </p>
<p><span m="348250">And if we say a vowel like aah, you get a fairly constant</span> <span m="352250">Fourier spectrum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="353930">And you can say, well, where are the peaks in</span> <span m="355800">that Fourier spectrum?</span> </p>
<p><span m="357080">And how do they correspond to the appearance of my mouth</span> <span m="360260">when I say the vowel?</span> </p>
<p><span m="362020">So here's how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="368980">So here's the Fourier spectrum of a particular vowel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="374130">And when you smooth that, those</span> <span m="376530">peaks are called formants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="378530">And so we're just going to keep track of the first and</span> <span m="380710">second formant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="382270">But when I say those things, I also can form an ellipse</span> <span m="385660">around my mouth when I say them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="388540">And when I form an ellipse around my mouth when I say</span> <span m="390560">them, that gives me this second modality.</span> </p>
<p><span m="395100">So the question is, is there a way of associating the</span> <span m="399010">gestures that produce the sound with the sound itself?</span> </p>
<p><span m="402690">Well, there's the human data conveniently provided by a</span> <span m="406600">variety of sources, including Michael Coen's wife who</span> <span m="410480">produced the lip contour data on the right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="413300">So that's all marked up and color coded according to the</span> <span m="417150">particular vowels in English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="418320">I guess there are ten of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421040">So we humans all learn that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423120">But guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="423610">We don't learn it from this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="425460">Because we don't get to work with any marked up data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="429170">We learn it from that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431360">Somehow we're exposed to the natural world, and we dig the</span> <span m="435710">vowel sounds out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="437190">It's fantastic how we do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="440890">But we do have cross modal coupling data and maybe that's</span> <span m="443405">got something to do with it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="445280">So here is a particular cluster of sounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="448345">And what I want to know is, can I merge any of these two</span> <span m="450680">clusters to form a bigger cluster with a</span> <span m="453260">corresponding meaning?</span> </p>
<p><span m="455159">So what I can do is, I can say, well, I can watch these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="459720">I know what the lip form is when a</span> <span m="462740">particular sound is made.</span> </p>
<p><span m="464780">So I have these correspondences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="466770">So maybe there are four of those, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470780">And maybe this same guy projects a couple</span> <span m="473980">of tones into that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="478210">And the question is, can this guy be combined with any of</span> <span m="483276">these guys?</span> </p>
<p><span m="484190">And the answer is yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485510">If they're close together on one side, maybe that suggests</span> <span m="488880">you ought to cluster them on the other side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="491090">But there's a question about what close means.</span> </p>
<p><span m="494830">So let's suppose that we also look at how these guys, these</span> <span m="499760">other two guys, project.</span> </p>
<p><span m="500555">And suppose this guy projects twice up here</span> <span m="504310">and once over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="507280">And this guy down here just projects like</span> <span m="510230">crazy into that guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="513380">Which are closer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="516320">These two or these two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="520510">Well, my diagram's getting a little closer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522190">But if you paid attention when I was drawing it, you would</span> <span m="525380">see that this guy projects in proportion to that guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="530570">So if we look at the-- if we take each of these projections</span> <span m="535030">as the components of a vector, then those two vectors are in</span> <span m="539440">the same direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="541380">And the cosine between them is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="544020">So these are the two that are closest together from that</span> <span m="548950">sort of perspective of that kind of metric.</span> </p>
<p><span m="551460">And those guys are the ones who get combined.</span> </p>
<p><span m="555106">Would you like to see a demonstration?</span> </p>
<p><span m="556793">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="557780">OK, here's a demonstration based on Coen's work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="569960">So here we have two sides.</span> </p>
<p><span m="572350">We could think of one side as being vowel sounds and the</span> <span m="575572">other side as being lip contours or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="578930">But you don't see anything in the diagram so far about how</span> <span m="582770">these things ought to be sorted out into groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="585490">So if I just take one step, why, it discovers that those</span> <span m="589080">two guys had the same projection</span> <span m="591760">pattern as each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="595700">So if I take another step and do the same thing on the other</span> <span m="598860">side, and now in the third step, the two areas that were</span> <span m="605130">formerly combined now form a super area.</span> </p>
<p><span m="607920">And they're seen to project in the same way as the blue area.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611260">So using this kind of projection idea, I can</span> <span m="614640">gradually build up an understanding of how those</span> <span m="617480">regions go together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="623310">And I discover, in this contrived example, that</span> <span m="626710">there's a vertical arrangement on the right side that</span> <span m="629290">corresponds to a horizontal arrangement on the left side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="632692">Now, you say to me, I'd like to see something a little bit</span> <span m="634670">more like the lip contour data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="637940">I'm just stepping through here until I get</span> <span m="639890">something I kind of like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="642400">Oh, that sounds good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="644020">That seems good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="646540">So there's a correspondence here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="648420">This is all made up data, Gaussians of various shapes</span> <span m="653730">and orientations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="655920">Let's see what happens when I run the clustering</span> <span m="658210">algorithm on that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="665300">Something definite was learned at every step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="667860">We find the correspondence between the pink region on the</span> <span m="671290">right and the pink region on the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="673320">In some cases, where the regions are rather blurred</span> <span m="675370">together, the other side is the one that helps the system</span> <span m="677730">figure out how things are organized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="681060">So I cite this as an example of something I</span> <span m="683390">think is very important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="684470">Number one, it's possible to discover regularity without</span> <span m="689230">being obsessively concerned with Bayesian probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="692440">And also, that there's very likely a whole lot of this</span> <span m="696940">going on in human intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="700480">When we emerge and begin to examine and explore the world</span> <span m="705630">around us, we're presented with a lot of unlabeled data</span> <span m="708520">that we've got to make sense of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="710460">And I believe that this kind of cross modal coupling idea</span> <span m="714540">is very likely to be bound up in our understanding of that</span> <span m="721340">world that's presented to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="723000">It's fast, it's direct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="724340">It doesn't take thousands of data points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="726465">It just happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="728700">And it happens effortlessly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="730450">And if this isn't built in--</span> <span m="733434">if this isn't determined to be built in, you can come back to</span> <span m="737700">MIT in 15 years and put me and jail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="740470">Because I think this is really the way it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="743900">So there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="744950">There's a couple of things to have wrapped up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="747800">And now the next thing I want to do for the rest of our last</span> <span m="754650">time together in this format is talk to you about</span> <span m="757780">a variety of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="759200">And I'll depart from my usual practice and</span> <span m="761690">move to some slides.</span> </p>
<p><span m="763380">So Dave, could we have the center screen, please?</span> </p>
<p><span m="776970">So first, a brief review of where we've been and where</span> <span m="780900">we've come.</span> </p>
<p><span m="783090">I think in the very first class, I talked about what</span> <span m="785600">artificial intelligence was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="787570">And I talked about how you could view it from either an</span> <span m="789640">engineering perspective or a scientific perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span m="792620">I'm on the scientific perspective side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794930">And I think, nothing against applications, but I think</span> <span m="798730">we'll be able to make much more sophisticated and</span> <span m="802820">wonderful applications if we have not only the engineering</span> <span m="805970">perspective about building stuff but also the scientific</span> <span m="809450">perspective about understanding the stuff to</span> <span m="811250">begin with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="814230">So both perspectives are important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="816790">And in this case you can see that they all involve</span> <span m="820590">representations, methods, and architectures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="822770">Dave, I've changed my mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="824850">Could you also give me the side screen so</span> <span m="826440">I can see it too?</span> </p>
<p><span m="833320">So, that's that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="835120">What's next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="835750">The business perspective, which we talked about on</span> <span m="837520">Thanksgiving.</span> </p>
<p><span m="838120">The important idea being that the knee-jerk expectation that</span> <span m="842950">the commercial value of something is in replacing</span> <span m="845300">people is something that is not sensible in the first</span> <span m="850850">instance, and demonstrated to be unlikely and untrue in the</span> <span m="854250">second instance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="855550">The thing that turns people on from the point of view of</span> <span m="857380">applications is not replacing people but making new revenue,</span> <span m="860790">making new capability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862760">And that at once licenses you to not have something done</span> <span m="865570">exclusively by a computer but something that can be done in</span> <span m="868620">partnership with a person.</span> </p>
<p><span m="870506">So all the important applications of artificial</span> <span m="873950">intelligence involve people and computers working in</span> <span m="878210">tandem, with each doing what they do best--</span> <span m="881740">not with replacing people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="885170">So that's that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="887410">Here's what AI does that makes AI different from the rest of</span> <span m="890550">the fields that attempt to contribute to an understanding</span> <span m="894370">of intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="896570">Now, we have the benefit of having a language for</span> <span m="899010">procedures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901430">We have all the metaphors that we are the custodians of in</span> <span m="907790">consequences of knowing about programming.</span> </p>
<p><span m="910926">We have the metaphor of garbage collection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="914410">We can talk about all sorts of things with programming</span> <span m="916770">metaphors that are unavailable to people in other fields that</span> <span m="922430">are interested in psychology.</span> </p>
<p><span m="925360">We have a way to make models because we can write programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="928450">And when we write programs, there's no question of</span> <span m="930280">sweeping things under the rug.</span> </p>
<p><span m="931510">We have to work out the details.</span> </p>
<p><span m="934690">And once we've done all that, then we have opportunities to</span> <span m="936720">experiment that are beyond the ability to experiment in most</span> <span m="942190">other fields.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943580">Oh, magnificent experiments are done these days in</span> <span m="945580">developmental psychology and all the rest of--</span> <span m="949010">all the other branches of psychology, including MRI</span> <span m="952020">studies that probe into your brain and see how it's</span> <span m="954130">consuming sugar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957010">But it's very difficult to ablate or take away some piece</span> <span m="959920">of your knowledge and see how you work without it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="963840">I can take the line-drawing program that we talked about</span> <span m="966600">and say, how will it do if it doesn't know anything about</span> <span m="968820">fork junctions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="970600">And we can determine an answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="973180">But I can't reach into Sebastian's head here with a</span> <span m="975620">surgical procedure and take out his</span> <span m="978350">knowledge of fork junctions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="980525">It just can't be done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="983270">And finally, another reason why we're different is because</span> <span m="985730">we can put upper bounds on how much knowledge is needed in</span> <span m="988460">order to perform a certain kind of task.</span> </p>
<p><span m="991530">These days, with bulldozer computing, the question most</span> <span m="994660">often asked is, how can you get billions of the things off</span> <span m="999130">the web and use them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001810">We--</span> <span m="1002280">I especially-- sometimes ask the opposite question, which</span> <span m="1005330">is how little knowledge can you have and still</span> <span m="1009310">understand a story?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1010550">That's what's interesting to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016630">So there's a methodological slide that talks to the</span> <span m="1019810">question of how you do artificial intelligence in</span> <span m="1022910">particular and, I suppose, science in general,</span> <span m="1026890">engineering in general.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1028770">There's a great tendency in this field to fall in love</span> <span m="1031329">with particular methods.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1032520">And we've had people who've devoted entire careers to</span> <span m="1034964">neural nets, genetic algorithms, Bayesian</span> <span m="1038520">probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1040829">And that's mechanism envy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1043480">And a better way, in my judgment, is to say, what is</span> <span m="1046579">the problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1047170">Scientific method-- what's the problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1048970">And then bring the right machinery to bear on the</span> <span m="1051070">problem, rather than looking for things to do with a</span> <span m="1053610">particular kind of machinery.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1056580">So this is the methodology that first articulated in a</span> <span m="1064080">forceful way, by David Marr.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066600">You want to start with the competence you're trying to</span> <span m="1068120">understand, then bring a representation to bear on it,</span> <span m="1072770">a representation that exposes the constraints and</span> <span m="1074770">regularities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1075470">Because without those, you can't make models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1077230">And without those models you can't understand it, explain</span> <span m="1081540">it, predict it, or control it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1084010">So it seems to make sense from a kind of MIT, model-centered</span> <span m="1088540">point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1090210">And only when you've got all that straight do you start</span> <span m="1091980">working on your methods and implement an experiment and</span> <span m="1094700">then go around that loop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1100330">So that's all I want to say by way of review, I suppose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1104320">I want to take a minute or two and just remind you of what's</span> <span m="1108270">on the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1108880">And there's nothing to remind because you all know what's on</span> <span m="1111110">the final already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1112565">We'll have four sections corresponding with four exams.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1117040">Then we'll have a fifth and final question that will be</span> <span m="1119830">everything else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1121750">All that stuff you slept through will be featured</span> <span m="1124760">there, as well a little problem on Bayesian inference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1131310">We rearranged the subject, mostly so I could write the</span> <span m="1133950">demonstrations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136400">So that the Bayesian stuff didn't come</span> <span m="1138770">before the fourth quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140100">Therefore the Bayesian stuff that you see on those previous</span> <span m="1143240">quizzes is likely to be harder than the stuff that we'll ask</span> <span m="1146500">on the final, because you haven't had as much experience</span> <span m="1148680">with it as people did last year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1151370">I've got a few icons on there to remind me to</span> <span m="1153280">tell you a few things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1155200">As always, open everything except for computers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159130">You can wear a costume.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1161680">You can do anything you like as long as it doesn't disturb</span> <span m="1164670">your neighbor, within reason.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1168650">Well, I guess if it doesn't disturb neighbor,</span> <span m="1170650">it is within reason.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1171680">So maybe that's all I need to say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176270">I'm not sure where we're going to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1177730">But it's certainly the case that, historically, there are</span> <span m="1180920">no visible clocks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1182960">So, we soon run out of all of our cellphones, wrist watches,</span> <span m="1186050">and other time pieces as we hand them out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1188450">So it pays to remember to bring some kind of timepiece,</span> <span m="1192430">because we won't be able to convey the time very well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1196120">And finally, I see a little calculator there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1199050">I don't recall any exam where you actually needed a</span> <span m="1201700">calculator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1202300">But it's sort of a security blanket to have one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1205270">People sometimes see a problem and say, oh my God, what am I</span> <span m="1207510">going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1207960">I left my calculator at home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1210450">So as to avoid that anxiety, you might want to bring one</span> <span m="1213990">even though you won't need it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1217070">So that's the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1218590">I'm sure there are no questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1220650">Are there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1221100">It's obvious.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1222900">Everybody will do well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1225420">Two shots, that whole thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1229480">Now, what to do next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230790">Suppose this subject has turned you on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233310">There are a variety of things that you should be thinking</span> <span m="1235310">about doing next semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1236345">And I wanted to review just a few of those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1239790">One of them is Marvin Minsky's subject, Society of Mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1244770">It's very different from this class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1247920">There are no prepared lectures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1251450">Marvin doesn't rehearse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1253690">He doesn't think about what he's going to say in advance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1257950">It's like this except it's just a</span> <span m="1260530">conversation with Marvin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1263000">So many people find themselves bored stiff for two lectures</span> <span m="1267430">out of three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1268650">But then in the third lecture, Marvin will say something that</span> <span m="1272720">you'll think about for a year or for the rest of your life.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1275890">That's what happens to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1277130">I'm bored stiff two out three times.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1278870">And then the third lecture he says something, and I think</span> <span m="1281560">about it for at least a year and maybe permanently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1285510">So it's an opportunity to see one of MIT's true geniuses</span> <span m="1290500">think out loud.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1292300">So it's an experience that you don't want to miss because</span> <span m="1294130">that's what you come here for, is to see the</span> <span m="1296470">geniuses think out loud.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1299970">Speaking of geniuses, then there's Bob Berwick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1302530">And he heroically is doing two subjects in the spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1307310">Both of which I'd take if I could.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1309960">One is his subject on Language Understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1315090">And the reason I'd take that is because I believe that</span> <span m="1316920">language is at the center of any explanation of our</span> <span m="1319520">intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1321100">So that's the subject I would be, I suppose, most inclined</span> <span m="1324330">to take if I were you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1326850">Well, maybe Minsky's.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1328460">It's hard to say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1329330">And incidentally, very heroically, Bob is also</span> <span m="1333450">teaching a course on how evolution works,</span> <span m="1335800">how it really works--</span> <span m="1337440">in so far as we know how it really works--</span> <span m="1339860">as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1340380">So both of those will be offered in the spring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1343130">I don't know how he does it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1345630">I don't know how he does two all at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1348720">Of course there are lots of places where you can go to</span> <span m="1350200">school, and the faculty will be teaching five courses at</span> <span m="1352770">the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1353800">I just think they're crazy or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355260">I don't know how that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1358110">Gerry Sussman will be teaching his Large Scale Symbolic</span> <span m="1363290">System subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1364890">That's sometimes--</span> <span m="1366840">oh, I forgot what he wasn't able to call it, something</span> <span m="1372600">that wasn't politically correct about programming for</span> <span m="1375340">people who really, really like to program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1379700">It's a splendid course on how to build really big systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382700">And we use the ideas in that subject in our research</span> <span m="1386250">system, because it's the only way--</span> <span m="1387970">understanding how that works is the only way that you can</span> <span m="1390010">build systems that are too big to be built.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1392845">I may say a word about that a little later.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396050">So those are my favorite three/four picks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1401030">But there's lots of other stuff, too</span> <span m="1402450">many things to cover--</span> <span m="1404090">the media lab, [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1405700">psychology.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1407020">There's tons of stuff out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1409070">And I would only mention that courses that have those three</span> <span m="1412550">names on them are bound to be good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1414880">These are colleagues that I think I have a important</span> <span m="1417800">perspective--</span> <span m="1418860">not necessarily one I agree with, but an important</span> <span m="1420830">perspective that you should understand--</span> <span m="1423000">Richards, Tenenbaum, and Sinha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1426300">And now we come to my spring course, the Human Intelligence</span> <span m="1428590">Enterprise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1431000">It's 6.XXX not because there's anything pornographic about it</span> <span m="1434190">but because for a long time, I couldn't remember it's number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1438580">So I developed a habit of referring to it as 6.XXX and</span> <span m="1441610">it seems to have stuck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1445630">Here's what that's about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1453310">Yeah, that might be interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1454320">It's taught like a humanities course, though.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456330">No lectures, I just talk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1460320">And all the TAs are veterans of that class so if you want</span> <span m="1463975">to know if you should do it, you have several resources.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1468030">You can talk to them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1471390">Or you could look at the sorts of things we talk about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1477100">Here are some things we talk about by way of packaging.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1485516">Yeah, I can hear a little tittering there because people</span> <span m="1487940">have discovered the last element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489810">Some people take the whole subject because they want to</span> <span m="1491750">be present for that unit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495460">And we talk about all those kinds of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1497280">And we look to see what the common elements are in all</span> <span m="1502370">those kinds of packaging problems of the sort that you</span> <span m="1505335">will face over and over again when you become an adult, no</span> <span m="1509290">matter what you do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511470">If you become a business person, an entrepreneur, a</span> <span m="1516010">military officer, a scientist, or an engineer, that packaging</span> <span m="1521360">stuff will often make the difference between whether you</span> <span m="1524280">succeed or don't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1528560">And then, that's the second way you can figure out whether</span> <span m="1530750">you want to take the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532480">The content, the TAs, and then of course you can always</span> <span m="1536330">appeal to the Underground Guide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1539720">And that's why it's very rare for someone that takes 6.XXX</span> <span m="1545080">who hasn't been at this final lecture because they read the</span> <span m="1548290">Underground Guide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1551090">Here is an element that appeared in the Underground</span> <span m="1554370">Guide a few years back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1566250">There are no exams.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570870">But there is a tradition of hacking the Underground Guide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1573930">So this is another example of something that appeared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1586230">So it all came about because early in the teaching of</span> <span m="1588870">6.XXX, I was whining to the students about the fact that</span> <span m="1592250">I've been at MIT for a long time, since I was freshman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1595490">And I still have yet to have any person I report to say</span> <span m="1599480">anything about my teaching--</span> <span m="1601210">good, bad, indifferent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1604230">Nothing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1605540">Not a word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1607010">So the students decided that it would be interesting to see</span> <span m="1609950">if they could say something sufficiently outrageous to</span> <span m="1612400">force a conversation between the department</span> <span m="1615140">chairman and me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1617750">And so far they've been totally unsuccessful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1620730">And I've tried everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1623490">Winston shows up late if he shows up at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629710">Good instructor but constantly sipping from</span> <span m="1631740">a brown paper bag.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636900">All kinds of stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1640360">But there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641430">It's a lot of fun.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1642910">It's a little oversubscribed so we have to have a lottery</span> <span m="1646220">and there's about 50% chance and so on and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1648560">But many of you will find it a good thing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1657340">Oh, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1657780">And now I also want to remind myself that there is a IP</span> <span m="1662150">event that's become kind of MIT tradition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1664690">It's the How to Speak lecture that I give.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667030">This year it'll be on January 28 in 6120.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1671690">6120 holds about 120 people and about 250 show up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1679850">So if you want to go to that lecture you should show up 15</span> <span m="1682670">minutes early.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1683380">That's a little secret just between me and 6034 students.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1689030">It's about packaging, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690990">It's a one-lecture version of 6.XXX.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694350">But it's very nonlinear because one thing that you</span> <span m="1696890">pick up from that one hour may make the difference between</span> <span m="1700860">you getting the job and some other slug getting the job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1704480">So it's one of those sorts of things that can make a big</span> <span m="1709240">difference in a short period of time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1711670">You may sleep through 50 minutes of the 55 minutes in</span> <span m="1714240">that lecture and stay awake for that one magical five</span> <span m="1717450">minutes when you learn something about when to tell a</span> <span m="1720250">joke or how to open a lecture or how to conclude one or a</span> <span m="1725870">job talk or a sales presentation or anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1730400">And that will make it worthwhile for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1733580">And then of course there's the possibility of your--</span> <span m="1736440">anybody who's doing [? UROP ?]</span> <span m="1737530">with me is likely to be interested in what I've</span> <span m="1742000">recently come to call a strong story hypothesis, something</span> <span m="1746600">that we've talked about from time to time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1752470">That's what makes us humans, and that's not what they are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755470">They're orangutans or chimpanzees, even though the</span> <span m="1758630">DNA that we share is--</span> <span m="1761020">it goes up and down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762580">At one point it was 96%, then it went to 98%.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1765760">Now I think it's back down to 97%.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1768610">But whatever we are, it's not because of a huge, massive</span> <span m="1772160">difference in DNA between us and our cousins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1776380">So in my group we build a Genesis</span> <span m="1779870">system, modestly called.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1782300">And that's what it looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1785950">And it has in it all the sorts of things that we've talked</span> <span m="1788490">about from time to time in 6034.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1792100">And it's about to move into areas that are especially</span> <span m="1795730">interesting, like can you detect the onset of a possible</span> <span m="1800250">disaster before it happens and intervene?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1803110">Can you retrieve presses based on higher-level concepts?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1806580">Things of that sort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810090">Would you like to see a demonstration?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1813910">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1814180">So you've see in a little bit of this before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815700">In fact, I'm not even sure what exactly I've</span> <span m="1819410">already shown you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820060">Let me just get over there to see what goes on here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824396">What I'm going to do right now is I'm just going to read</span> <span m="1829680">about Macbeth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1831222">A short precis of the plot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834220">Not the whole thing, of course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1836060">Just a few sentences about the plot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1840630">Right now what it's doing is absorbing the English and</span> <span m="1843420">translating into a sort of internal language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1846612">A sort of universal, internal language that's all about</span> <span m="1850500">trajectories and transitions and social</span> <span m="1853280">relationships and all that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1855370">So it's being read there by two different persona.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1860800">Each of those personas has a different educational</span> <span m="1864000">background, you might say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1865040">They might represent different cultures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1868690">So eventually they build up graphs like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872060">And everything in white is stuff that's</span> <span m="1873790">explicit in the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1875580">And everything that's in grey is stuff that's been inferred</span> <span m="1879495">by the system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1881520">So there are several layers of understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1883220">One is what's there explicitly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1886040">And the other thing that's there is stuff</span> <span m="1887510">that's readily inferred.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1889415">And because these persona have different educational</span> <span m="1892350">backgrounds, you might say they see the killing of</span> <span m="1897681">Macbeth at the end of the play in a different</span> <span m="1901490">light from one another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1903540">One sees it as an act of insane violence and the other</span> <span m="1905870">sees it as a consequence of a revenge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1910440">So once you've got that capability, you can do all</span> <span m="1912680">sorts of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1913240">For example, you can ask questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1916470">So let me arrange it to ask-- by the way, this is a live</span> <span m="1919080">demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1919455">I'm thrilled to pieces that it actually works so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923250">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1924050">Why did Macbeth kill Duncan?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936600">You all know why, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1942430">Yeah, you're right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943400">He didn't actually do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1944400">On a common sense level, neither Dr. Jeckll nor Mr.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1947400">Hyde have an opinion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1949065">On a reflective level neither Dr. Jeckll more Mr. Hyde have</span> <span m="1952420">an opinion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1953000">That's because it didn't happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1955580">So we call these two persona Doctor Jeckll and Mr. Hyde.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1961280">And you're ready to complain right away about the spelling</span> <span m="1963620">of Jeckll, aren't you?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1964990">Well, that's because with this spelling the speech generator</span> <span m="1969220">makes it sound a little bit more like when we say Jekyll.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1973550">But what really happened is that Macduff killed Macbeth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979820">On a common sense level, it looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks</span> <span m="1982520">Macduff kills Macbeth because Macduff is insane.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985730">It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks Macduff kills Macbeth because</span> <span m="1988570">Macbeth angers Macduff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1990710">On a reflective level, it looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks</span> <span m="1993410">Macduff kills Macbeth as part of an act of insane violence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997460">It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks Macduff kills Macbeth as part</span> <span m="2000700">of acts of mistake, Pyrrhic victory, and revenge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2004180">Isn't that cool?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005440">I bet you'd get an A if you had said that in eighth grade.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2013670">But once you've got this ability to understand the</span> <span m="2017500">story from multiple points of view, you begin to think of</span> <span m="2019380">all kinds of wonderful things you can do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022090">For example, you can have Dr. Jeckll negotiate with Mr.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2025610">Hyde, because Dr. Jeckll will be able to understand Mr.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028950">Hyde's point of view and demonstrate to Mr. Hyde that</span> <span m="2033220">he thinks that point of view is legitimate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2037960">Or, Dr. Jeckll can teach Mr. Hyde the subject matter of a</span> <span m="2042650">new domain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2044740">Or Dr. Jeckll can watch what's happening in Mr. Hyde's mind</span> <span m="2050290">and avert disaster before it happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2053020">So let me just show you another situation here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057770">I want to turn on the onset detector and read another</span> <span m="2060630">little snippet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2061219">This one is about--</span> <span m="2063620">what should I do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2067610">We'll do the Russia and Estonia cyber war.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072900">It's reading background knowledge right now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075820">But pretty soon, in the upper left-hand corner, as it begins</span> <span m="2077850">to read the story, you'll see it spotting the onset of</span> <span m="2081250">potential revenge operations or potential Pyrrhic</span> <span m="2083739">victories, and show their foundations begin to emerge</span> <span m="2089370">and giving the system an opportunity to intervene.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2094790">So there you can see all the things that it</span> <span m="2096540">thinks might happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2099690">Not all of them do happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2101370">But some of them do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2102773">And you'll note, incidentally, that this is another case of</span> <span m="2106820">Dr. Jeckll and Mr. Hyde having different cultural</span> <span m="2108900">perspectives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2110440">One's an ally of Russia and one's an ally of Estonia.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113300">One sees it as unwarranted revenge and the other sees it</span> <span m="2115650">as teaching a lesson.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2119720">So, I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2121480">What else have we got here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2123970">Oh yeah, president recall.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2126540">A long time ago, we talked about doing information</span> <span m="2128880">retrieval based on vectors of keyword counts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2133210">That's cool but not this cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2134860">This is doing it on vectors of concepts that appear in the</span> <span m="2137780">stories, such as revenge, even though the word revenge</span> <span m="2141540">doesn't appear anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143160">So because we're able to understand the story on</span> <span m="2145750">multiple levels, we can use those higher levels that don't</span> <span m="2148860">involve the words in the story at all to drive</span> <span m="2152010">the retrieval process.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2154980">So all that is a consequence of a variety of things, one of</span> <span m="2158510">which is the specialists that translate the English into an</span> <span m="2164340">internal language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2166200">And it's also, incidentally--</span> <span m="2167360">I mentioned it a little before--</span> <span m="2169330">it's also a consequence of our use of Gerry Sussman's</span> <span m="2173910">propagator architecture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2175740">So a student comes into our group and says</span> <span m="2177465">he wants to do something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178060">And we say OK, here's how the system is organized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2181870">It's like a bunch of boxes that are wired together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2185560">So you get a box and we'll tell you what the inputs are</span> <span m="2188250">going to look like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189300">And we'll tell you what we want on the outputs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190690">And if you don't like the inputs, just ignore them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2194370">And if we don't like your outputs,</span> <span m="2195630">we'll just ignore that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2196500">So nobody can screw up anything because they have a</span> <span m="2199210">very circumscribed piece of the system to work with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2203520">So I can say, for example, the president wanted Iraq to move</span> <span m="2212110">toward democracy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2216490">And bingo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2217120">That starts a propagation through that network.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2226730">All this would be unconvincing, in my view, if</span> <span m="2229802">it weren't eventually connected to perception.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2231810">Because if it's not eventually connected with perception,</span> <span m="2234270">it's yet another system that demonstrates how smart it can</span> <span m="2237580">seem to be without actually knowing anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2240420">So another half of what we do is an early stage attempt to</span> <span m="2245780">connect the language stuff with things that are going on</span> <span m="2248410">in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250720">So we say, imagine a jumping action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2252950">And there is a jumping action that's part of a test sweep</span> <span m="2256640">developed by the Defense Research Projects Agency to</span> <span m="2259240">drive what they call the Mind's Eye program, which was</span> <span m="2263120">developed largely as a consequence of work done here</span> <span m="2265090">at MIT, focused on the idea that if we're going to</span> <span m="2267770">understand the nature of intelligence, we have to</span> <span m="2270370">understand how language is coupled into our perceptual</span> <span m="2274090">systems and how those perceptual systems can answer</span> <span m="2276580">questions posed to them by the language system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2286000">That's a little demo of the Genesis system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2287710">Here are the issues that we're trying to explore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2289740">Nothing too serious, just the nature of what is</span> <span m="2292530">extraordinarily fundamental to any</span> <span m="2294270">explanation of human thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300860">Now, all of this might turn you on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2303050">And you say to me, well, you're sick and tired of MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2306370">You'd like to go somewhere else for graduate school.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2308290">So now that I've demonstrated what we do here, one of the</span> <span m="2311900">many things we do here, I'll talk a little bit about other</span> <span m="2314360">places you can go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2315200">This is a sort of MIT-centric view of the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2321450">It represents all of the places you could go</span> <span m="2323250">when I was a kid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2327310">But while I've got this particular</span> <span m="2328490">diagram on here, I just--</span> <span m="2329990">sort of testing my MIT arrogance--</span> <span m="2331670">I remember a story often told by my</span> <span m="2334330">colleague Peter Szolovits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2336025">He says that when he came to a job interview from Caltech to</span> <span m="2339770">MIT, he was sitting here for three days and</span> <span m="2342330">nobody spoke to him.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2343210">So eventually he said, I've got to do something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346740">He walked up to a graduate student and said, hi my name</span> <span m="2349960">is Peter Szolovits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351375">I'm from Caltech.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353370">And the graduate student said, Caltech</span> <span m="2354940">sucks, and walked away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2359780">Anyway, we've populated all these places now that you see</span> <span m="2363740">here, and more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2365040">This is just a list that I scratched up this morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2366910">I'm sure I've forgotten many that have equal right</span> <span m="2372490">to be on this list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374810">But in the end, which one you go to depends on who you want</span> <span m="2378190">to apprentice yourself to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2380270">Because a graduate school is an apprenticeship.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2383100">And that means if you go to a place with just one person,</span> <span m="2385560">it's OK if that's the person you want to apprentice</span> <span m="2387990">yourself to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389210">Each of these places has a different focus because they</span> <span m="2391450">have different people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393790">So you need to find out if there's somebody at any of</span> <span m="2396260">these places.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2396900">It doesn't matter if it's AI or some other field.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400340">Theoretical physic-- you've got to find out if there's</span> <span m="2401930">somebody at that place you want to</span> <span m="2403570">apprentice yourself to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404480">So those site visits are really important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407380">And I would like to also stress that when you make your</span> <span m="2409110">application to graduate school, it's very different</span> <span m="2413310">from applying to undergraduate school.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2416030">Because they don't care whether their school is good</span> <span m="2418870">for you at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2421650">They only care about one thing--</span> <span m="2423480">whether you're good for their school.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2426450">So don't get confused and talk about how it's a</span> <span m="2428190">wonderful fit for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2429060">Because what they're interested in is whether</span> <span m="2430360">you're going to contribute to their research program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2435860">Oh, I should say that if you're applying to artificial</span> <span m="2437490">intelligence that means you don't say, I'm interested in</span> <span m="2440870">all aspects of thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442900">You need to be focused.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2446240">There's another reason why you don't say that you're</span> <span m="2447630">interested in all aspects of thinking and that is the</span> <span m="2450180">defect theory of AI career selection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2453820">It seems to be the case, strange though it may seem,</span> <span m="2457800">that people in artificial intelligence often specialize</span> <span m="2460960">their research on the things that they don't do very well</span> <span m="2463050">themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2464880">So people who study language, with the exception of Bob</span> <span m="2467020">Berwick, often have trouble getting</span> <span m="2469790">out a coherent sentence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2472180">And people who do hand-eye coordination are the sorts who</span> <span m="2476140">spill their coffee.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2478540">So don't say you want to study all thinking because--</span> <span m="2484530">The most extreme case of this, though, is--</span> <span m="2488390">if you don't mind, I'll tell you a story about an extreme</span> <span m="2490370">case in this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2491740">We had a visitor from Japan in the old artificial</span> <span m="2494360">intelligence lab many years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2495920">He came for a year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2497000">Let's call him Yoshiaki, just to pick a name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2502080">Yoshiaki spent a year at the artificial intelligence lab,</span> <span m="2504760">and he left his wife in Japan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2508300">And the reason was, she was pregnant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2510752">And at that time, you could not get a visa to the United</span> <span m="2514360">States unless you had a smallpox vaccination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517240">And because she was pregnant, she didn't want to get a</span> <span m="2518990">smallpox vaccination because there's a small danger to the</span> <span m="2523650">fetus if you get a smallpox vaccination</span> <span m="2525485">while you're pregnant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527000">So she stayed back there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2529060">So Yoshiaki, let us call him--</span> <span m="2531580">it was a day before he was to get on the</span> <span m="2532960">airplane to go home.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533950">I walked into his office and his desk was covered with</span> <span m="2537190">pictures of his wife.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539080">By the way, Yoshiaki, I should tell you, is a computer vision</span> <span m="2541630">guy, interested in object recognition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2547070">So you might suspect he has some problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2549030">So he's looking at these pictures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2550140">I thought, oh my God, this is a tender moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2551880">He's anticipating his return to Japan and</span> <span m="2555140">reunion with his wife.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2557140">So I muttered something to that effect.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2559620">And then he looked at me like I was the king of the fools.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2562530">And he said, it's not a question tenderness.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2565470">I'm afraid I won't recognize her at the Tokyo airport.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2569880">So I said, Yoshiaki.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2572220">How can this be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2572720">You study computer vision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2574260">You study object recognition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2575930">This is your wife.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2578400">How can you think you wouldn't recognize her</span> <span m="2580395">at the Tokyo airport?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2583220">And then he looks at me, and--</span> <span m="2584370">God is my witness-- he says, they all look alike.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2596760">Well now as we come close to the end,</span> <span m="2598860">what are the big questions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2599680">Is it useful?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600130">Of course it's useful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2601310">It's part of the toolkit, now, of everybody who claims to be</span> <span m="2603630">a computer scientist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605310">What are the powerful ideas and these things?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2606730">Well, here's the most powerful, powerful idea is the</span> <span m="2610290">idea of powerful idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2613200">And here are a few of my favorites.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617900">No surprises there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2618930">That's just Winston's picks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2623030">But there's one more I would like to add.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625340">And that is all great ideas are simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2628100">A lot of times we at MIT confuse value with complexity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2631770">And many of the things that were the simplest in this</span> <span m="2633660">subject are actually the most powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2636860">So be careful about confusing simplicity with triviality and</span> <span m="2645160">thinking that something can't be important unless it's</span> <span m="2647000">complicated and deeply mathematical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2649580">It's usually the intuition that's powerful, and the</span> <span m="2653270">mathematics is the [INAUDIBLE] element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2658080">Sometimes people argue that real intelligence is possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2662090">One of the most common arguments is, well what if we</span> <span m="2664700">had a room?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666170">And you're in the room and you're asked to translate some</span> <span m="2668630">Chinese documents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2669890">You've got a bunch of books.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2673490">And in the end you could do the translation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2674920">But you cannot be said to understand Chinese.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2677750">This is the argument of Berkeley</span> <span m="2683260">philosopher named Sorel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686960">So the trouble is, it's also true--</span> <span m="2689200">well, the argument is the books aren't intelligent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2692950">They're just ink on a page.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2694900">And the person is just a computer, just a processor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2698300">It doesn't actually know anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2701360">So since it can't be in either the person or the</span> <span m="2703660">books, it can't be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2705436">And that just forgets that there's a magic that comes</span> <span m="2710410">about when a running program, when a process, executes in</span> <span m="2714940">time over knowledge that it continually contributes to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2718980">So the reductionist arguments are among the many that have</span> <span m="2722680">been ineffectually posed to argue that artificial</span> <span m="2726630">intelligence is impossible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2730170">But that bears longer discussion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2732990">Let me just bring up the biggest issue in my mind,</span> <span m="2735980">which is, it's not the question of whether we humans</span> <span m="2740890">are too smart to have our intelligence duplicated or</span> <span m="2745260">excelled in a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2746180">It's a question whether we're smart enough to pull it off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2749780">I once had a pet raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754096">Now, it's illegal to have a pet raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2756110">But this one was an orphan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2758710">Its mother had been hit by a car or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761510">A friend of mine brought the raccoon to me knowing I kind</span> <span m="2763772">of like animals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765900">And I have to say, I kept the raccoon for a year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2768600">At that point, she wanted to go out and be on her own.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2773250">So I had this raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2774840">And this raccoon is smarter than any dog I've ever had.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2777760">Within a day, she learned how to pry the</span> <span m="2779620">refrigerator door open.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2781670">So I spent that whole year taping the refrigerator door</span> <span m="2784150">shut every time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2786810">And then, we'd play jokes on each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2791520">She wouldn't eat hot dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793440">And I wanted her to eat hot dogs desperately because</span> <span m="2795030">they're cheap and easy to serve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2797880">All she would eat was cooked chicken wings,</span> <span m="2801300">wouldn't eat hot dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2802020">So one day I said, well, I'm going to play a trick on her.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2804755">I took a chicken bone.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2805950">I stuck it in the middle of a hot dog and put it in a</span> <span m="2807790">garbage can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2808770">And she went for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809800">Her genes took over and she went for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2811705">And she was happy with hot dogs ever after.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2815390">She wouldn't let me read.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2816790">She would crawl up underneath the book and</span> <span m="2823050">interfere and make me--</span> <span m="2825140">she always wanted to suck on my thumb, which turned blue</span> <span m="2827480">eventually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2828070">You'd be amazed at how much a raccoon can suck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2832320">It's just extremely powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2834610">The best parts were when she would go bike riding with me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2838540">I put on a heavy sweater because they have</span> <span m="2840040">a pretty good grip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2840900">I'd put on a heavy sweater and she'd kind of mount herself on</span> <span m="2844710">my back and look out over my shoulder, stopped traffic for</span> <span m="2847440">miles around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2851460">So she was really smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2852460">But the interesting thing is that at no point did I ever</span> <span m="2856960">presume that that raccoon was smart enough to build a</span> <span m="2859460">machine that was as smart as a raccoon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2862420">So when we think that we can, it involves a certain element</span> <span m="2864790">of hubris that may or may not be justified.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2871000">Well, there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872730">Just a couple more things to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2874880">One of which is, you should understand that Kendra and</span> <span m="2883005">Kenny and Yuan and Martin and Gleb are doing a lot of stuff</span> <span m="2889610">that's outside their job description.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2891846">All of these quiz review deals that they've arranged are not</span> <span m="2897290">in their job description.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2898300">I didn't ask them to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2899800">That's all just plain old professionalism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2902710">So they've been wonderful to work with and</span> <span m="2904120">I'd just like to--</span> <span m="2905085">[APPLAUSE]</span> <span m="2916470">--offer them a round of applause.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2918710">And of course, Bob and Randy and Mark have done fabulous</span> <span m="2924180">stuff as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2925810">And we of the staff, the TAs, Mark, Bob, and Randy, have</span> <span m="2934520">nothing else to do except wish you good hunting on the final</span> <span m="2941360">and a good long winter solstice hibernation period</span> <span m="2945350">after that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2947270">And that is the end of the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2950420">And we hope you live happily ever after.</span> </p>

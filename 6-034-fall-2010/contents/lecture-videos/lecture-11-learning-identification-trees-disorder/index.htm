<p><span m="9310">PATRICK WINSTON: Ladies and gentlemen, the Romanian</span> <span m="11300">national anthem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="12960">I did not ask you to stand, because I didn't play it as a</span> <span m="15930">symbol of Romanian national identity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="18250">But rather, to celebrate the end of the Cold War, which</span> <span m="21580">occurred about the time that you were born.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24740">Before that, no one came to MIT from Eastern Europe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="28980">But since that time, we've been blessed by having in our</span> <span m="33070">midst Lithuanians, Estonians, Poles, Czecs, Slovaks,</span> <span m="40850">Bulgarians, Romanians, Slovenians, Serbs, and all</span> <span m="47400">sorts of people from regions of the world</span> <span m="50510">formally excluded to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="53580">Believe me, you are all welcome in our house.</span> </p>
<p><span m="57900">Almost all, that is to say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="60110">Because you may recall that Romania is the traditional</span> <span m="64530">home of vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="67430">And since the end of the Cold War, vampires have had new</span> <span m="70180">vectors for emerging from their traditional places and</span> <span m="74360">penetrating into the world at large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="76010">You may have vampire in your suite, or on your floor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="82560">And it's important to know how to recognize them, and take</span> <span m="86740">the necessary precautions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90420">So if you have this concern, I would expect that the first</span> <span m="96860">thing you would do would be to look at some data concerning</span> <span m="100009">the characteristics of vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="115550">So there's a little database of samples of individuals who</span> <span m="120460">have been determined to be vampires and not vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="126560">And our task today--</span> <span m="128020">and what you'll understand how to do by the end of the hour--</span> <span m="130919">is to use data like this to build a recognition mechanism</span> <span m="134640">that would help you to identify whether someone is a</span> <span m="137740">vampire or an ordinary person.</span> </p>
<p><span m="141000">So this is a little different from the kind of problem we</span> <span m="144079">worked with neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="147360">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="147700">So what's the most conspicuous difference between this data</span> <span m="152579">set and anything you could think to work on with nearest</span> <span m="158590">neighbors, which we studied last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="160079">Katie, do you have any thoughts about why it would be</span> <span m="162772">difficult to use nearest neighbors with data like this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="168260">The question mark is there because this is MIT, and a lot</span> <span m="171690">of people are completely nocturnal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="173170">So you can't tell whether they cast a shadow or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="177630">We want to take that into account.</span> </p>
<p><span m="181220">So what's different about this from the</span> <span m="184150">electrical cover data set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="186851">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="192810">PATRICK WINSTON: Could you use the nearest neighbor technique</span> <span m="194550">to identify vampires with this data?</span> </p>
<p><span m="198180">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="205620">PATRICK WINSTON: So obviously--</span> <span m="207120">Yes, Lana?</span> </p>
<p><span m="209831">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="213807">STUDENT: You cannot really quantify--</span> <span m="215800">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, that's the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="217110">This is not numerical data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="218970">This is symbolic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="221138">So we're not saying that your ability to</span> <span m="224579">cast a shadow is 0.7.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227320">You either cast a shadow, down cast a</span> <span m="229970">shadow, or we can't tell.</span> </p>
<p><span m="231200">It's a symbolic result.</span> </p>
<p><span m="233770">So problem number one we have to face with data of this kind</span> <span m="237810">is that it's not numeric.</span> </p>
<p><span m="245480">And there are other characteristics, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="247950">For example, it's not clear that all of these</span> <span m="251180">characteristics actually matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="253820">So some characteristics don't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="266460">And a corollary to that is that some characteristics do</span> <span m="269990">matter, but they only matter part of the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="292240">And finally, there's the matter of cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="298880">Some of these tests may be more expensive to</span> <span m="301400">perform than others.</span> </p>
<p><span m="303350">For example, if you wanted to determine whether someone</span> <span m="305740">casts a shadow, you'd have to go to the trouble of getting</span> <span m="307930">up during daylight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="309970">That might be an expensive operation for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="315100">You'd have to go find some garlic and ask them to eat it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="317570">That might be expensive.</span> </p>
<p><span m="319070">So some of these tests might be expensive</span> <span m="321140">relative to other tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323560">But once you realize that we are talking in terms of tests,</span> <span m="328110">and not a vector of real values, then</span> <span m="332530">what you do is clear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334920">You build yourself a little tree of tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="340680">So who knows how this problem will turn out?</span> </p>
<p><span m="343810">But you can imagine a situation where you have one</span> <span m="347210">test up here which might have three outcomes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="352740">And one but only one of those outcomes might require you to</span> <span m="357520">perform another test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="361020">And only when you've created the tree of tests that look</span> <span m="365940">like this are you finished.</span> </p>
<p><span m="370540">So given this set of tests and a set of samples, the question</span> <span m="375060">becomes, how do you arrange the tests in a tree like that</span> <span m="378640">so as to do the identification that you want to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="382250">So since we're talking about identification, it's not</span> <span m="385030">surprising that this kind of tree is called an</span> <span m="388250">identification tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="401560">And there's a tendency-- and I may slip into it myself-- to</span> <span m="404420">call this a decision tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="406210">But a decision tree is a label for something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="408970">This is an identification tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="411060">And the task is to create a good one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="415170">So what is a good one versus a not so good one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="419330">What characteristic would you like for a decision tree--</span> <span m="425010">for an identification trade to have, if you're going to call</span> <span m="428250">it good identification tree?</span> </p>
<p><span m="432170">What do you think, Krishna?</span> </p>
<p><span m="433265">What would be a good characteristic?</span> </p>
<p><span m="435964">STUDENT: Maybe the minimum number of levels?</span> </p>
<p><span m="438399">PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="438886">He said minimum number of levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="442110">What's another way you could say what a good one is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="446960">Each test costs something, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="448680">So what's another way of thinking about what a good</span> <span m="452050">tree would look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="453864">STUDENT: Minimum cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="454820">PATRICK WINSTON: The minimum cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="456280">And if they all have the same cost, then it's</span> <span m="459810">the number of tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="461770">So overall, what you like is a small tree</span> <span m="465530">rather than a big one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="467400">So you might be able to take your sample data and divide it</span> <span m="469730">up, so that at the bottom of the tree, at the leaves, all</span> <span m="473190">of the sets that are produced by the tests are uniform,</span> <span m="477380">homogeneous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="479070">We'd like that tree to be the simplest possible tree you can</span> <span m="481905">find, not some big complicated one that also divides up all</span> <span m="485460">the data into uniform subsets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="488920">By uniform subset--</span> <span m="490070">at the bottom of the tree, you have all of the vampires</span> <span m="493100">together, and all the non-vampires together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="496980">So you'd like a small tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="497840">So why not just go all the way and do British Museum, and</span> <span m="503590">calculate all possible trees?</span> </p>
<p><span m="505946">Well, you can do that, but it's one of those NP problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="508730">And as you know, NP problems suck in general.</span> </p>
<p><span m="512620">And so you don't want to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="513929">You want to have some kind of heuristic mechanism for</span> <span m="517820">building a small tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="519640">And we want a small tree because--</span> <span m="522590">Why do we want a small tree?</span> </p>
<p><span m="523900">Because of the cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="525040">but there's another, more important reason why we want a</span> <span m="526870">small tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="528025">Let me give you a hint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="530250">It's Occam's Razor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532090">The simplest explanation is often the best explanation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="537110">So if you have a big, complicated explanation,</span> <span m="538650">that's probably less good than a simple, small explanation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546150">Occam's Razor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="547400">Spelled so many ways it doesn't matter how I spell it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="550290">And that's good, because I can't spell.</span> </p>
<p><span m="555260">So how are we going to go about finding the best</span> <span m="560040">possible arrangement of those four tests</span> <span m="564180">in a tree like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="566470">Well, step one will be to see what each test</span> <span m="569630">does with the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="570340">And by the way, before I go a step further, you know and I</span> <span m="576070">know that this is a sample data set that's very small,</span> <span m="580740">suitable for classroom manipulation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="583090">You'd never bet your life on a data set this small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="587090">We use it only for classroom illustration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="589020">But imagine that these rows are multiplied by 10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="591970">So instead of eight samples, you've got 80.</span> </p>
<p><span m="595500">Then you might begin to believe the</span> <span m="596670">results that are produced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="598220">So I'm just going to pretend that each one of those</span> <span m="600700">represents 10 other samples that I</span> <span m="604330">haven't bothered to show.</span> </p>
<p><span m="607530">But we can work with this one in the classroom, because it's</span> <span m="610290">pretty small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610990">And we can say, well, what does this shadow test do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="616034">Well, the shadow test divides the sample population into</span> <span m="620310">three groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="621780">There's the I Don't Know group of people who are nocturnal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="624790">There are the people who do cast the</span> <span m="626110">shadow, the Yes people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="628360">And the people who do not cast a shadow, the No people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="632220">So if I look at those rows up there and see which ones are</span> <span m="637430">vampires, it looks to me that if there's no shadow cast--</span> <span m="644440">there's only one that doesn't cast a shadow--</span> <span m="646140">and that is a vampire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="651670">So that's a plus over there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="653950">Vampire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="656400">Now, if we look at the ones who do cast a shadow, all</span> <span m="659680">those are not vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660715">They're all OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="665870">And now there're 8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="667520">Three are vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="669450">So that means that two of these must be vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="673040">And I've got three, four, five, six so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="675420">So there must be two left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="677340">So that's the way the shadow test divides up the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680730">Now let's do garlic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="685620">Vampires traditionally don't eat garlic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="688040">I don't know why.</span> </p>
<p><span m="691710">So we look at the garlic test, and we see</span> <span m="693480">that all of the Nos--</span> <span m="697010">well, there're three Yeses, and they all</span> <span m="699880">produce a No answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="701920">So if somebody eats garlic, they're not vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="706590">That means the three vampires must be over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="709650">Then there are two left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="710580">So that's what the garlic test does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="713040">See what we're trying to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="713960">We're trying to look at all these tests to see which one</span> <span m="716530">we like best on the basis of how it divides up the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="721220">So now we've got complexion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="733210">And there are three choices for this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="735970">You can have an average complexion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="737530">But a lot of vampires, in my experience, are rather pale.</span> </p>
<p><span m="741490">So pale is a possibility.</span> </p>
<p><span m="743650">And then the other option is that just after gorging</span> <span m="746210">themselves with blood, they tend to get a</span> <span m="747610">little red in the face.</span> </p>
<p><span m="749300">So we'll have a ruddy over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="752640">Once again, we have to go back to our data set to see how</span> <span m="755650">this test divides things up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757640">So there are three ruddies, and one's a No, one's a No,</span> <span m="763980">and one's a Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="764670">So two Nos and a Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="769650">Two Nos and a Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="772680">Now we can try for pale complexion people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="775300">There are only two of those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="777100">A No and a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="783310">That must mean that there are two pluses over here, because</span> <span m="786310">there are three vampires altogether.</span> </p>
<p><span m="788370">Two, four, six, seven, eight, nine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="793681">Eight, sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794848">Eight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="795724">Only eight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797480">Just one more to go, and that's the accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="802520">Historically, vampires go to great length to protect their</span> <span m="807560">accent and not betray their origins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="809600">But nevertheless, we can expect that if</span> <span m="812900">they've just arrived--</span> <span m="813850">if they're just in from</span> <span m="815450">Transylvania, part of Romania--</span> <span m="817470">they may still have an accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="818590">So there's a normal, some still have a heavy accent, and</span> <span m="821950">some persist in having odd accents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829940">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="831090">Accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="831660">Four of them, right at the top, have no accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="834630">Two Nos and a Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="843050">Heavy accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844930">Three of those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="845910">A Yes and two Nos.</span> </p>
<p><span m="853190">That means we must have a plus here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="855710">3, 6, plus and a minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="860790">So we can look at this data and say, well, what will be</span> <span m="864400">the best test to use?</span> </p>
<p><span m="865610">And the best test to use would surely be the one that</span> <span m="870860">produces sets here, at the bottom of the branches, that</span> <span m="876710">correspond to the outcomes of the test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="878950">We're looking for a test that produces homogeneous groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="884750">So just for the sake of illustration, I'm going to</span> <span m="888120">suppose that we're going to judge the quality of the test</span> <span m="891200">by how many sample individuals it put into a homogeneous set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="896010">So ideally, we'd like a test that will put all the vampires</span> <span m="900910">in one group and all the ordinary people in another</span> <span m="903670">group right off the bat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905530">But there are no such tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907260">But we can add up the number of sample individuals who are</span> <span m="911400">put in to at least homogeneous sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="914460">So when we do that, this guy has 3 in a</span> <span m="918140">homogeneous set here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="919470">A fourth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="920480">But these are not a homogeneous set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="922770">So the overall score for this guy will be 4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="928740">This one, well, not quite as good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="931690">It only puts 3 individuals in a homogeneous set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="938110">This one here, 2 individuals into a homogeneous set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="942870">Everybody else is all mixed up with some</span> <span m="945150">other kind of person.</span> </p>
<p><span m="946950">And over here, how many samples are in</span> <span m="949920">a homogeneous set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="951670">0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955260">So on the basis of this analysis, you would conclude</span> <span m="959370">that the ordering of the test with respect to their quality</span> <span m="962470">is left to right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="964250">So the best test must be the shadow test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="967210">So let's pick the shadow test first, see what</span> <span m="971840">we can do with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="973330">If we pick the shadow test first, then we have this</span> <span m="976850">arrangement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="980080">We have question mark, and we have Yes, casts a shadow, and</span> <span m="985200">No, doesn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="986610">We have 3 minuses here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="988800">We have a plus here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="990290">And unfortunately, over here, we have plus,</span> <span m="992890">plus, minus, minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="994060">So we need another test to divide that group up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="997757">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998731">STUDENT: How did you get the 4 on the shadow test again?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001653">Why was it 4?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1004100">PATRICK WINSTON: Well, if I look at the</span> <span m="1004760">data and I see who--</span> <span m="1008870">the question is, what about that shadow test?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1011100">If you look at the shadow test, and you say, well, there</span> <span m="1012990">are 4 question marks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1015270">And if we look and see what kind of people belong to those</span> <span m="1017210">4 question marks, there are 2 vampires and 2 non-vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020990">That's why it's 2 pluses and 2 minuses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1022760">STUDENT: No, I understand that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1024148">The question is, how did you get to the score of 4?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027853">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1030450">The question is how did I get this number 4?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1032780">It has nothing to do this, because this is a mixed set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1034829">In fact, I've got three guys in a homogeneous set here, and</span> <span m="1037810">one guy in a homogeneous set here, and I'm</span> <span m="1039240">just adding them up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1040398">STUDENT: OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1041079">PATRICK WINSTON: So very simple classroom illustration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1043190">Wouldn't work in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1044790">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1045098">STUDENT: How do you adjust this for larger data sets</span> <span m="1047969">where it's unlikely you're going to have any [INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050390">PATRICK WINSTON: The question is, how do I adjust this for</span> <span m="1051770">larger data sets?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1052580">You're one step ahead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058540">Trust me, I'll be doing large data sets in a moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1060540">I just want to get the idea across.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1063550">And I don't want there to be any thought that the method we</span> <span m="1066210">use for larger data sets has got anything magic about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1070720">OK, so we're off and running.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1072450">And now we have to pick a test that will divide</span> <span m="1076710">those four guys up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1078590">So we're going to have to work this a little harder, and</span> <span m="1082060">repeat the analysis we did there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1083610">But at least it'll be simpler, because now we're only</span> <span m="1085350">considering 4 samples, not 8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1087220">Just the 4 samples that we still have to divide up that</span> <span m="1089930">have come down that left branch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1092240">So I have the shadow test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1098190">It has 3 outcomes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1099580">We have the garlic test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1104000">It has 2 outcomes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106080">Yes and No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1107560">We have the complexion test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1114290">There's 3 outcomes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1117100">Average, pale, and ruddy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1120230">And we have finally the accent test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1124860">And that comes out to be either normal, heavy, or odd.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1130610">And now, it's a little awkward to figure out what the results</span> <span m="1133340">are for this data set as shown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136500">So let me just strike out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140910">The ones that we're no longer concerned with, and limit our</span> <span m="1144000">analysis to the samples for which the outcome of the</span> <span m="1147240">shadow test is a question mark.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1148790">This is exactly the four people we still need to</span> <span m="1150740">separate, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1153240">So switching colors, keeping the color the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1158170">We actually don't want to do the shadow</span> <span m="1160460">test anymore, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1161340">Because we've already done that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162810">There's no point in doing that again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1164100">We don't have to look at that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1167170">It's already done all the division of data that it can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1170890">So the garlic test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1172260">Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173050">Garlic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173920">2 Yeses, 2 Nos.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175480">The Yeses produce Nos and the Nos produce Yeses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1179040">So if the person does eat garlic, they're OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1184210">And if they don't eat garlic, bad news-- they're vampires.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1188686">Well, that looks like a pretty good test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1190320">But just for the sake of working it all out, let's try</span> <span m="1192420">the others.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1193820">Complexion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1196920">2 Ruddies, a Yes, and a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1205190">1 pale, and that's a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209540">1 pale, and that's a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1212370">And we must have 1 average, and sure enough, that's a Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1217590">Now we can do accent, the one on the far right, and look at</span> <span m="1219790">how that measures up against the people who are still under</span> <span m="1223820">consideration as samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1225860">Accent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1226550">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1226990">2 Nones, a Yes and a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233930">No Heavies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1234840">2 Odds, a Yes and a No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1239396">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1239850">So now we can do the same thing we did before, and just</span> <span m="1242060">say, for sake of classroom illustration, how many</span> <span m="1245400">individuals are put into a homogeneous sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1248230">And here we have 4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1251120">And here we have 2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1254830">And here we have 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1258420">So plainly, the garlic test is the test of choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1262000">So we go back over here, and we've completed the work that</span> <span m="1264810">we needed to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266860">So that's the garlic test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1269970">And that produces 2 pluses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273070">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1274630">Eats garlic, Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276340">Eats garlic, No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1278480">I guess the pluses go over here like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282565">And these are the two ordinary people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1284860">And we're done with our task.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1286710">And now you can quickly run off and put this into your</span> <span m="1290080">PDA, and forever be protected against the possibility that</span> <span m="1293360">one of those vampires got out in the flood of people that</span> <span m="1296135">came in from Eastern Europe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1298380">Except what do we do a large data set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1302220">Well, the trouble is, a large data set's</span> <span m="1304280">not likely to produce--</span> <span m="1312130">if you have a large data set, no test is likely to put</span> <span m="1315320">together any homogeneous set right off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318310">So you never get started.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1320300">Everything would be 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1322210">Every test would say, oh it doesn't put anybody into</span> <span m="1325110">homogeneous sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1326280">So you're screwed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330910">You need some other, more sophisticated way of measuring</span> <span m="1336000">how disordered this data is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1337580">Or how disordered these sets are that you find at the</span> <span m="1342040">bottom of the tree branches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1344740">That's what you need.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1345500">You need a way of measuring disorder of these sets that</span> <span m="1351130">you find at the bottom of these branches, so you can</span> <span m="1354740">find a kind of overall quality to the test based on your</span> <span m="1357750">measurement of disorder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1360250">Now, the first heuristic of a good life is, when you have a</span> <span m="1364010">problem to solve, ask somebody who knows the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1367120">It's the least amount of work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1368180">It's not even as hard going to Google.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1371060">So who would you ask about ways of</span> <span m="1375010">measuring disorder in sets?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1378260">There are two possible answers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1385050">STUDENT: You could just do entropy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387060">PATRICK WINSTON: What?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387325">STUDENT: Find the entropy of the set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389840">PATRICK WINSTON: Who studies entropy?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391345">STUDENT: Probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1393350">PATRICK WINSTON: What kind of classes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395402">STUDENT: Physics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395898">STUDENT: Thermodynamics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396890">PATRICK WINSTON: Thermodynamics!</span> </p>
<p><span m="1398415">The thermodynamicists are good at measuring disorder, because</span> <span m="1401125">that's what thermodynamics is all about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402900">Entropy increasing over time, and all that sort of stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1405640">There's another equally good answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1408834">STUDENT: Statisticians?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410720">PATRICK WINSTON: Statisticians.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1413400">Perhaps, but it's not the second best answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1417680">It's actually not even the best answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419190">That's the best answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419930">What's your name?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420643">STUDENT: Leo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1421510">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1425322">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="1429150">PATRICK WINSTON: Leonardo has got his finger on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1430870">The information theorists are pretty good at measuring</span> <span m="1433420">disorder, because that's what information is all about, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1437440">So we might as well borrow a mechanism for measuring the</span> <span m="1440130">disorder of a set from those information theory guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443970">So what we're going to do is exactly that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448610">Let's put it over here, so we'll have it handy when we</span> <span m="1451760">want to try to measure those things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456910">The gospel according to information theorists is that</span> <span m="1461800">the disorder, D, or some set is equal to-- now let's</span> <span m="1468910">suppose that this is a set of binary values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472500">So we have positives and then we have negatives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1474720">Pluses and minuses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1476490">But pluses, they don't go very well in an algebraic equation,</span> <span m="1479640">because they might be confused with adding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1481790">So I'm going to say P and N. And then it'll be the total,</span> <span m="1485900">which is P plus N. We only have two choices,</span> <span m="1488030">positive and negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1490090">So the disorder of set, according those guys, is equal</span> <span m="1493850">to minus the number of positives over the total</span> <span m="1499400">number, times the log to the base 2 of the positives over</span> <span m="1505440">the total, minus the negatives over the total, times the log</span> <span m="1513260">2 of the negatives over the total.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516270">Those negatives look a little worrisome, because you think,</span> <span m="1518780">well, maybe this thing can go negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1520210">But that's not going to be true, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521390">Because these ratios are all less than 1, and the logarithm</span> <span m="1526170">of something that's less than 1 is negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1529830">So we're OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532770">So that's a lovely way of measuring disorder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1537040">And then we ought to draw a graph of what</span> <span m="1539020">that curve looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1544370">And what we're going to graph it against is the ratio of</span> <span m="1547720">positives to the total number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1552500">So that's going to be an axis where we go from 0 to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561140">So let's just find a couple of useful values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1565750">And by the way, it pays to pay attention to these curves,</span> <span m="1568920">because if you pay attention to this stuff, you can work</span> <span m="1571890">the quiz questions on this very rapidly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1574980">Otherwise, we see people getting out their calculators</span> <span m="1579460">and quickly becoming both lost and screwed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1584020">OK so let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1586160">Let's suppose that the number of positives is equal to the</span> <span m="1589100">number of negatives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1589810">So we've got a completely mixed-up set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1592260">It has no bias in either direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1594470">So in that case, if P over T is equal to 1/2, then this is</span> <span m="1601310">equal to minus 1/2, times the logarithm of 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611230">And I guess, since they're both the same, we</span> <span m="1613360">can multiply by two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1615400">And what's that value?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1620596">[INAUDIBLE], what does that calculate out to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1624768">STUDENT: Minus [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1626716">PATRICK WINSTON: Minus [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629650">Well, with a minus sign, you just turn the argument upside</span> <span m="1631790">down, so it's log(2).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632950">So what's log(2)?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1634890">Logarithm of base 2 of 2?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1638920">1!</span> </p>
<p><span m="1639870">So this whole thing is--</span> <span m="1642720">STUDENT: 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643020">PATRICK WINSTON: 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1644000">So [INAUDIBLE], in her soft way, says, well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1647650">2 times 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1648800">That cancels out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1649710">The minus, that flips the arguments so it's log to the</span> <span m="1652680">base 2 of 2, and that's 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1655640">So this whole thing, You work out the algebra,</span> <span m="1658785">it gives you 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1660710">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1663740">So right here in the middle where they're equal, we get a</span> <span m="1667460">value of 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1671800">Next thing we need to do is let's calculate what happens</span> <span m="1674610">if P over T is equal to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1679610">That is to say, everything is a positive.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681450">Any guesses?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1683100">Maybe 10, 20, minus 15?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1686410">Let's work it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1688650">So if P over T equal 1, that would be minus 1 times the log</span> <span m="1696946">to the base 2 of 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1701120">What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702642">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1704040">PATRICK WINSTON: A 0?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1705570">Oh, yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1705910">Because 2 raise to the 0 is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1710430">So this part is 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714310">Now, what about this other part?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1718810">If everything's a P, then nothing's an N.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1721190">So we've got 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1722320">And we can quit already.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724820">Well, not quite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725590">We ought to work it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1726710">Log 2 to the base 2 of 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1730290">What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1731344">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1733320">PATRICK WINSTON: Who?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1734710">Minus infinity?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1736110">Uh oh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1737100">0 times minus infinity is What I didn't get that when I was</span> <span m="1740140">in high school.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742470">Finally, 1801 makes a difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1746550">Finally.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1747390">What's the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1749630">We're interested in the limit as N over T goes to 0, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1756280">And when you have a deal like this, what do you do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1760392">You use that famous rule, that we all mispronounce when we</span> <span m="1765330">see it written, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1767600">We use the good old El Hospital's rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1771240">OK, it's L'Hopital.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1773210">L'Hopital's Rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1774610">You have to differentiate the--</span> <span m="1776720">I guess we differentiate this guy as a ratio or something,</span> <span m="1780880">and see what happens when it goes to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1782610">And what we get when we use L'Hopital's Rule is that, oh</span> <span m="1786130">thank God, this is still zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1790100">So now we know that we have a point up there and a point</span> <span m="1792980">down there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1795740">So now we've got three points on the curve,</span> <span m="1797410">and we can draw it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1801310">It goes like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1805140">No, it doesn't go like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1806260">It's obviously a Gaussian, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808400">Because everything in a nature is a Gaussian.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810240">Can you put that laptop away, please?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1811640">Everything in nature is a Gaussian, so</span> <span m="1813260">it looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818158">That right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1821020">No, actually, not everything in nature is a Gaussian.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823840">And in particular, this one isn't a Gaussian either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1826880">It looks more like one of those metal things they used</span> <span m="1830400">to call quonset huts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1832660">That's what it looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834612">Boom, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837100">So that is the curve of interest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1840270">Now, did God say that using this way of measuring disorder</span> <span m="1843540">was the best way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1845950">No, Got has not indicated any choice here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851930">We use this because it's a convenient mechanism, it seems</span> <span m="1855570">to make sense, but in contrast to the reason it's used</span> <span m="1858440">information theory, it's not the result of some elegant</span> <span m="1861690">mathematics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1862270">It's just a borrowing of something that seems to work</span> <span m="1864870">pretty well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1866870">Any of those curves would work just about the same, because</span> <span m="1869560">all we're doing with it is measuring how</span> <span m="1871240">disordered a set is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1873780">So one thing to note here is that in this situation, where</span> <span m="1878950">we're dealing with two choices--</span> <span m="1880350">P and N, positives and negatives--</span> <span m="1883340">we get a curve that maxes out at one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1886450">And notice that it kind of gets up there pretty fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1888830">In fact, if you're down here at 2/3, are you're up here,</span> <span m="1893890">this is about 0.9.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1899090">So it gives you a large number for quite a bit of that area</span> <span m="1903770">in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1905940">So that, unfortunately, still doesn't tell us everything we</span> <span m="1909210">need to know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1909550">That tells us how to measure a disorder in one of these sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1913700">But we want to know how to measure the quality of the</span> <span m="1915680">test overall.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1917750">So we need some mechanism that says, OK, given that this test</span> <span m="1920950">produces three different sets, and we now have a measure of</span> <span m="1924370">the disorder in each of these sets, how do we measure the</span> <span m="1928100">overall quality of the test?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1931496">Well, you could just add up the disorder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934360">Let's write that down, because that sounds good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943960">So you can say that the quality of a test is equal to</span> <span m="1953200">some sum over the sets produced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1961280">And what we're going to do is we're going to add up the</span> <span m="1962640">disorder of each of those sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969380">I'm almost home, except that this means we're going to give</span> <span m="1973220">equal weight to a branch that has almost nothing down it--</span> <span m="1980210">we're going to give the same weight to that as a branch</span> <span m="1983190">that has almost everything going down it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985920">So that doesn't seem that make sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1987150">So one final flourish is we're going to weight this sum</span> <span m="1992050">according to the fraction of the samples that end up down</span> <span m="1996360">that branch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1998200">So it's, as usual, easier to write it down than to say it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2001840">So we're going to multiply that times the number of</span> <span m="2007370">samples in the set, divided by the number of</span> <span m="2021530">samples handled by test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2034610">So if half the samples go down a branch, and if that branch</span> <span m="2037570">has a certain disorder, then we're going to multiply that</span> <span m="2041500">disorder times 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2044090">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2044570">So now let's see how it works with our sample problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048610">Well, here is our sample data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2051139">And we didn't need anything fancy for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2052780">But let's pretend it was a large data set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2056270">Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2056790">What would we do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057590">Well, go down this way, there are 4</span> <span m="2063020">samples down that direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2064639">That's half of the total number of samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2066790">So whatever we find down there, we're going</span> <span m="2068139">to multiply by 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2069820">This one we're going to multiply by 3/8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072150">And this one we're going to multiply by 1/8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075889">Now, what do we actually find at the bottom of these things?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2077969">Well, here's a homogeneous set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080170">Everything's the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2081770">So we go to that curve and say, what is the disorder of a</span> <span m="2084560">homogeneous set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085949">It's zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2090380">Let's see, they're all the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2092090">I guess that means it's 0 over there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2097640">So the disorder of this set of three samples is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2104470">The disorder of this set of one sample, all</span> <span m="2107260">the same, is zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2110110">The disorder of this set-- well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113720">Half of the samples there are plus, and half are minus, so</span> <span m="2116780">we go over to our curve, and we say, what's the disorder of</span> <span m="2120830">something with equal mixture of pluses and minuses?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2123640">And that's one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2125500">So the disorder of this guy is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2128560">So now we've got 1/2 times 1, and 3/8 times 0, 1/8 times 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2133590">So the quality of this particular test, as determined</span> <span m="2138660">by the disorder of the sets it produces, is 1/5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143770">0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148420">Let's do this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150420">So we have 3/8 coming down this way, 5/8</span> <span m="2153910">coming down this way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2155270">3/8 is multiplied by the disorder of a</span> <span m="2157610">set of uniform things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2158730">That's disorder 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2161370">So this guy over here, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164540">That's 2/5 and 3/5 multiplied--</span> <span m="2169160">You know, this is one of those deals where if you look at the</span> <span m="2171010">curve, you're pretty close to the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174840">And that curve goes all the way up to about 0.9 there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178470">So you can kind of just look at this, and eyeball it, and</span> <span m="2180560">say, well, whatever it is, the overall, this is going to be</span> <span m="2187010">something multiplied times 5/8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189060">Something like 0.9 times 5/8.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2191680">So let's just say, for the sake of discussion, that</span> <span m="2195440">that's going to be about 0.6, which is within a hundredth, I</span> <span m="2199550">think, of being right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201340">Just kind of guessing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2204220">OK, well now we're on a roll.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2205440">Here, we have 3/8 coming down this branch, 3/8 coming down</span> <span m="2209040">this branch, 1/4 coming down this branch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2212640">This is 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2214510">And this is one of those deals where these two are about 0.9.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2218910">So it looks like it's going to be 3/8 plus 3/8 is 3/4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225680">Times about 0.9.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2227640">So that's going to turn out to be about 0.7.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2237710">So one last go here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239230">3/8, 3/8, and 1/4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244850">Oh, that's interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2246280">Because these two are what we got</span> <span m="2249890">contributed up to that 0.7.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2252490">This one is 0.4 times--</span> <span m="2254390">this is evenly divided, so that's going to</span> <span m="2257090">have disorder of 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2260380">So that's going to be 0.25 bigger than the</span> <span m="2263910">number we got over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2265610">So that's going to end up being about 0.95.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271410">So thanks god our answer is the same as we got with our</span> <span m="2273980">simple classroom measurement of disorder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277130">Except this is measuring how disordered stuff is, we want</span> <span m="2279800">the small number, not the big number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282520">So once again, based on this analysis, you'll be sure to</span> <span m="2286110">pick the shadow cast, because 0.5 is less than 0.6, which is</span> <span m="2290730">less than 0.7, which is less than 0.95.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293640">So that accent test is really horrible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2296310">Don't use it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2298380">Just because somebody has a heavy accent doesn't mean</span> <span m="2300160">they're a vampire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2301430">In fact, most vampires have worked very hard on their</span> <span m="2304240">accent, as I mentioned before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2306450">All right, so now we know that we're still going to pick the</span> <span m="2308470">shadow test as our first go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2312440">So that's good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2314040">Now, let's see if we can repeat the exercise with our</span> <span m="2316460">second selection, the one we have to have to pick those</span> <span m="2319290">guys apart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2320910">And this is going to be easier, because there are</span> <span m="2322760">fewer things to work with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2324280">Ooh, wow, look.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2325700">That's 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2327930">That's 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2329030">That's 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2330530">That's 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2333000">So the disorder of this guy is 0.0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2338030">So this is 1/4, 1/4, 1/2, 0, 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345630">1/2 times 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2347140">Ooh, that's 0.5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2349590">That was easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2350500">How about this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351740">Oh, he says 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353300">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353500">That's 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354210">That's 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2355170">That's 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356130">That's 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356890">Yeah, it is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2360130">So sure enough, the answer also comes out to be the same</span> <span m="2362480">as before, when we did our just</span> <span m="2364450">simple intuition exercise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2367160">So I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2368710">Christopher, is this all about using information theory?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2373895">STUDENT: No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374320">PATRICK WINSTON: No, no, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2378230">See, it's not about the math.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2380010">It's about the intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2381000">And the intuition is that you want to build a tree that's as</span> <span m="2383630">simple as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384750">And you can build a tree that's as simple as possible</span> <span m="2387500">if you look at the data, and say, well, which test does the</span> <span m="2390610">best job of splitting things up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2392640">Which test does the best job of building subsets underneath</span> <span m="2396150">it that are as homogeneous as possible?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2399310">So all this information theory, all this entropy</span> <span m="2403330">stuff, is just a convenient mechanism for doing something</span> <span m="2407290">that is intuitionally sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2409440">OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2410175">It's not about information theory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2411840">It's about a sound intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415990">Oh, by the way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2416400">Does this kind of stuff ever get used in practice?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2419440">10s of thousands of times.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2421780">This is a winning mechanism that's used over and over</span> <span m="2425400">again, even when the data is numeric.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2430320">How would it work if it's numeric data?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432170">Well, let's think about that for a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2441820">So let's suppose that we have an opportunity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2445620">We're an EMT or something, we work in the infirmary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2448430">What do they call it these days?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2449360">Something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2449940">But anyhow, you work in that kind of area, and you have the</span> <span m="2452500">opportunity to take people's temperature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2455420">And so over time, you've accumulated some data on the</span> <span m="2460230">temperature of people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2462320">And maybe you've found that there's a vampire</span> <span m="2464020">here at about 102.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2467140">There's a normal person here, about 98.6.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2469980">But then they're scattered around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474590">Some people have fevers when they come in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2476960">So the question is, is there a way of using numerical data--</span> <span m="2479950">things that you can put real numbers--</span> <span m="2482750">is there a way of using that with this mechanism?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2485180">And the answer is yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2486320">You just say, is the temperature greater than or</span> <span m="2489180">less than some threshold?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490910">And that gives you a test, a binary test, just like any of</span> <span m="2493620">these other tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2496460">[? Krishna? ?]</span> <span m="2497000">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2498930">But where would I put the threshold?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2504660">I suppose I could just put it at the average value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2508480">But that might not be the place that does the best job</span> <span m="2511100">of splitting the samples into homogeneous groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517400">Christopher?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517690">STUDENT: So you run this numerical analysis on</span> <span m="2519788">different places with different thresholds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521150">PATRICK WINSTON: So you try different places, he says.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2524070">And he's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2525340">Because this is a computer, this is our slave.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527980">We don't care how much it works to figure</span> <span m="2529930">out the right threshold.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531660">So what we do is we say, well, maybe the threshold's halfway</span> <span m="2535610">between those two guys, or halfway between those two</span> <span m="2537835">guys, or those two guys, or those two guys,</span> <span m="2539450">or those two guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2540940">So we can try one less threshold</span> <span m="2542540">than we have samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543600">And we don't care if there are 10,000 samples, because this</span> <span m="2545600">is a computer, and we don't care if it works all night.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2548720">So that's how you find the threshold for a numeric test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2552750">By the way, I assured you earlier on you would never use</span> <span m="2554520">the same test twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2555360">Is that true for this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2558190">Yes, you would still never use the same test twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2559910">But what you might do is you might use a different</span> <span m="2561320">threshold on the same measurement</span> <span m="2564860">the next time around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2566940">So when you start having numerical data, you may find</span> <span m="2569480">yourself using the same test with the same axis but with a</span> <span m="2577730">different value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2580000">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2580330">So now that we have this, then we can go back and compare how</span> <span m="2585500">this method would look when we put it up against the sort of</span> <span m="2590660">stuff we were talking about last time, with</span> <span m="2595290">the electrical covers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600980">So with the electrical covers, we had a situation like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605020">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605470">We had samples that were places like this, and we had a</span> <span m="2611290">division of the space that look pretty much like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617220">Not quite exactly in the right spots, but pretty close.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2622000">So these are the decision boundaries for the situation</span> <span m="2625660">where we are using nearest neighbors to</span> <span m="2627540">divide up the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630608">What would the decision boundaries look like if these</span> <span m="2633310">were four different kinds of things, and we were using this</span> <span m="2637940">kind of mechanism?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2641560">And maybe there's a lot of samples all clustered around</span> <span m="2644640">places like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647170">What would the decision boundaries look like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2649280">Would they be the same as this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651830">god, I hope not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2652470">Why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2654400">Because what we're going to do is we're going to use a</span> <span m="2656700">threshold on each axis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2660320">So therefore, the decision boundaries are going to be</span> <span m="2662990">parallel to one axis or the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666100">So we might decide, for example--</span> <span m="2669460">Oh, shoot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670220">I think I'll draw it again, because it'll get confused if</span> <span m="2672480">I draw it over the other one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2674530">So it looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2677720">And that's how nearest neighbors does it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2680270">But a identification tree approach will pick a threshold</span> <span m="2684540">along one axis or the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2685870">Let's say it's this axis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2688340">It's only got one choice there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2689580">So it's going to put a line there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693370">And now, what's the next thing it does?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2695820">Well, it still has these two different kinds</span> <span m="2699370">of things to separate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2700250">We're going to assume we've got four</span> <span m="2701300">different kinds of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2703380">So it's going to say, oh!</span> </p>
<p><span m="2706220">I've Come down the negative side, so I need a threshold on</span> <span m="2712650">the remaining data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2714440">And these are the only two things that are now remaining.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2717260">So my only choice is to put a threshold in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2723030">Now I guarantee this, absolutely guaranteed--</span> <span m="2726370">on the quiz, somebody--</span> <span m="2728570">presumably somebody who doesn't go to lectures--</span> <span m="2731090">will draw that line all the way across.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2732890">And that's desperately wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2735730">Because we've already divided this data set in half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2739780">Now the choice of what we do over here is governed only by</span> <span m="2743170">the remaining samples that we see, these two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2746270">And so the threshold is going to go in there like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2752150">So that's what happens when you go back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2755050">This is used 10s of thousands of times.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2759270">Always used.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2760250">What are the virtues of it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761460">Number one, you don't use all the tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765360">You use only the test that seem to be doing some useful</span> <span m="2767630">work for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2769250">So that means that you do a better job, because your</span> <span m="2771750">measurement technique is simpler.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2773580">And it costs less, because you're not going to the</span> <span m="2777220">expense of doing all of the testing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2781140">So it's a real winner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782910">But you know what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784230">Some classes of people--</span> <span m="2786200">not scientists, but I mean people like doctors and stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2790420">They don't like to look at these tress.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793750">They're kind of rule-oriented.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2796170">So they look a tree like this for determining what kind of</span> <span m="2800370">thyroid disease you have, and it would have maybe 20 or so</span> <span m="2805420">tests in it of various kinds of hormones, like thyroxine</span> <span m="2808670">and this and that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2810200">And they say, ah, we can't deal with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2812560">So we have to work with them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2816400">So what we do is we convert the tree into a set of rules.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2821230">How do we convert the tree into a set of rules?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2829720">Oops, wrong one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2832560">Go away, go away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2836310">Here's what I want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837030">Yeah, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2838070">How would we convert this tree into a set of rules?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2841480">It's straightforward.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2842470">[INAUDIBLE], what do we do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843680">STUDENT: You'd basically just look down each branch--</span> <span m="2845390">PATRICK WINSTON: You'd basically just go down each</span> <span m="2846730">branch to a leaf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2848510">So you say, for example, here's one rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2851990">If shadow equals question mark, and garlic equals oh,</span> <span m="2864970">[INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="2865770">want to choose No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2870012">Doesn't eat garlic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2871880">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872350">I think I'll say Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2874130">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2874810">That changes the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2883740">Then if it eats garlic, it's not a vampire, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2887430">That's one of four possible rules, because there are four</span> <span m="2889700">leaf nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2892440">Now, almost done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2895900">We are done, except for one thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2897170">We can actually take these four rules, and start thinking</span> <span m="2900160">about how to simplify them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901950">You can ask questions like, if I have a rule that tests both</span> <span m="2906140">the shadow and the garlic, do I actually need both of those</span> <span m="2910280">antecedents?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2910550">And the answer is, in many cases, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2912950">And in particular, in this case, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2915890">Because if we look at our data set, what we discover is that</span> <span m="2920700">in the event that we're talking about a shadow</span> <span m="2925180">question mark--</span> <span m="2926285">oh, I guess I had a better choice the other way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929240">Oh, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929880">If you look at the garlic, all the garlics--</span> <span m="2933200">Yes, Yes, and Yes--</span> <span m="2935300">it turns out that the answer is no, independent of what the</span> <span m="2937600">shadow condition is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2939630">So we can look at the rules, and in some cases, we'll</span> <span m="2941680">discover that our tree is a little bit more complicated</span> <span m="2944050">than it needs to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2944730">We can actually get rid of some of the clauses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2946800">So in the end, we can develop a very simple mechanism based</span> <span m="2950340">on good old fashioned rule-based behavior, like you</span> <span m="2952760">saw almost in the beginning of the subject,</span> <span m="2955820">that does the job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2956940">And now, without any royalty, you're all free to put this in</span> <span m="2962710">your PDA and use it to protect yourself in the days to com,</span> <span m="2965610">especially since Halloween's just around the corner.</span> </p>

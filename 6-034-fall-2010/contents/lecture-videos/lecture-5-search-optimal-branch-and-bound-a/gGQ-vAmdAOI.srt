1
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:12,180
PROFESSOR: It was written about
Route 66, which used to

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,640
be the main highway between
Chicago, Illinois and Los

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,610
Angeles, California.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,860
Very famous highway because
anybody who wanted to go

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,550
across country always took route
66 because it was the

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,950
shortest way to go.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,620
And the question is, how do you
find the shortest path?

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,760
Not just any old path or a good
path, but how do you find

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,230
the very shortest path?

10
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,764
And that'll be the subject
that we're

11
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:38,660
going to discuss today.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,560
But route 66, I lament its
passing, but it's been largely

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,570
replaced by the interstate
highway system that was

14
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,350
created by President
Eisenhower.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,600
Guess why?

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,860
Let's see, maybe the
ROTC people know.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,840
You know why Eisenhower
created the

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,800
interstate highway system?

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,670
Well, in public affairs, of
course, there's always a

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,420
distinction to be
made between the

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,990
explanation and the reason.

22
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,276
The explanation was--

23
00:01:13,276 --> 00:01:16,463
AUDIENCE: To move weapons
across the country?

24
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:17,560
PROFESSOR: Well,
to move nuclear

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,700
weapons across the country.

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
Let's put it in, sightly,
more benign terms.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,240
Eisenhower had observed that
the German army was able to

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,950
move its troops rapidly, even
though we bombed their

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,910
railroads into oblivion because
of their auto bond.

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,473
So Eisenhower conceived that if
there were ever an invasion

31
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:39,600
in the United States, we too
would want to be able to move

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,300
our forces around on
a highway system.

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,340
And consequence of that, we
have a pretty good highway

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,009
system and pretty awful
railroad system.

35
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,060
It's interesting.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,410
I'm a beneficiary of that, in a
funny way, because I'm from

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,050
East Peoria, Illinois.

38
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,600
And I was surrounded by the
factors of Caterpillar Tractor

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,725
Company, which made all of the
tractors that built all of

40
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:01,990
those roads.

41
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,180
So my high school spent money
like water from that huge tax

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,270
base of all those factors.

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,990
Anyway, today we want to find
the very best path, instead of

44
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,550
just a good path.

45
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:26,050
And like the last time, we'll
deal with, both, an example

46
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,640
that we can set our program
to work on.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,180
By the way, can you find the
shortest path between S and G?

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,885
Would you like to bet your
life on the shortest path

49
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,000
between S and G?

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,920
Probably, not.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,600
With your eye, you can
find a good path.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,020
But you can't find the
best possible path.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,500
Today, what we're doing is
probably not modeling any

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,550
obvious property of what we
have inside our heads.

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,610
But being able to find the best
path is part of the skill

56
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,260
set that anybody who's had a
course artificial intelligence

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,270
would be expected to have.

58
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,010
So we're going to look at it,
even though it's not like many

59
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,170
of the things we do.

60
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,660
A model of something
that's, probably,

61
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,520
going on in your head.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,710
So we're going to use, both,
this example from Cambridge

63
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,450
and our Blackboard example.

64
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's see, we have to
caution ourselves.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,320
Tanya, is search about maps?

66
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,690
No, it's about what?

67
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,829
Starts with a C. And the next
letter is H. And it ends up

68
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,750
being choice.

69
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,460
So we're talking about choice.

70
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,240
Not about maps.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,150
Even though our examples are
drawn from maps because

72
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,410
they're convenient, they're
visual, and helps understand

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,190
the concepts behind the
algorithms I'm talking about.

74
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,390
So let's start off by looking
at our classroom example.

75
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,570
And I did something today that
I neglected to do last time.

76
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,030
And that's talk to you
about what I meant

77
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,810
by heuristic distance.

78
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,350
It's those pink lines that
I just drew on the map.

79
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,130
We're talking about the distance
as the crow would fly

80
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,520
between two places, even though
there's no road that

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,200
goes between those two places.

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,100
So in general, and we discussed
last time, it's best

83
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,950
to get yourself into a place
that's close, as the crow

84
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,170
flies, to your goal.

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,740
And of course, that's a
heuristic and it can get you

86
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,020
in trouble because it's
not always true.

87
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,630
It would appear that being at
node E is a good place to be

88
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,040
because it's not very far from
G. But in that particular case

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,030
designed to illustrate the
point, being close is,

90
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,770
actually, not a good thing
because it's a dead end.

91
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,110
But in general, it's a good
thing to be close.

92
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,150
And we talked last time about
hill climbing and beam search,

93
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,580
being close was the objective
of those kinds of searches.

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,060
And at one point, in a beam
search illustration, we had C,

95
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,980
B, A, and D. We had paths
terminating at all four of

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,980
those nodes as candidates for
the next round of search.

97
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,660
And we decided on the basis of
these airline distances to

98
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,720
keep D and B, and reject A and C
because they're further away

99
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,060
as the crow flies.

100
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,340
Now, I repeat this even though
many of you have had this

101
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,790
fixed already in your tutorials
because we're going

102
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,450
to need this concept of
heuristic distance today.

103
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:28,250
And I wanted to be sure that
that point has been clarified.

104
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,030
So now, with this smaller map I
imagine you can do, by eye,

105
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,580
a determination of what
the shortest path is.

106
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,230
What is it, Juana?

107
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,584
Can you help me out with that?

108
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:43,800
AUDIENCE: S, A, D, G.

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,820
PROFESSOR: S, A, D, G. And if
you add up those distances,

110
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,430
the distance is 11 along that
path that goes from S, first

111
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,640
to A, and then to D, and then
from D to G. So Juana asserts

112
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,860
that that is the best path.

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,540
And we're going to treat Juana
as an Oracle because we're

114
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,830
going to follow, in our initial
attempt to understand

115
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,590
these algorithms,
a very important

116
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,020
principle of problem solving.

117
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,770
And that is that, if you want
to solve a problem, the

118
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,810
easiest way is, usually, ask
somebody who knows the answer.

119
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,290
Or Google, which also, probably,
knows the answer.

120
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,290
So in this particular case,
we believe that

121
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,270
Juana knows the answer.

122
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,170
And she said that the shortest
path is S,A, D, G, and its

123
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,310
path length is 11.

124
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,680
But we don't trust her because
we're applying to the same

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,673
medical school and she may
be trying to screw us.

126
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:42,140
[LAUGHTER]

127
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,380
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
be very cautious about

128
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,320
accepting her answer until we've
checked it to make sure

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,750
that she hasn't attempted
to delude us.

130
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,970
So how do we go about
doing that?

131
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,490
Well, one way to do that is to
check to be sure that all

132
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,380
other possible paths that we
could develop end up being,

133
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,700
for sure, longer than the one
that Juana has told us about.

134
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:16,910
So she's told us about S, A, D,
G. And it has a total path

135
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,610
length of 11.

136
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,500
And now what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to develop

137
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,995
the rest of this tree-like
diagram.

138
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,380
But what I'm going to do is,
I'm not going to do it in a

139
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,270
British Museum or random way.

140
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,830
What I'm going to do is, I'm
going to look at the choice

141
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,960
that corresponds the shortest
path that can be extended.

142
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,159
So the shortest path that
can be extended is

143
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,620
this one right here.

144
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,480
The one that just has the
starting node in it.

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,880
And I could have gone this other
way to B. And if I go

146
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,870
that other way to B, then
the path length along

147
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,240
that side is 5.

148
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,760
And likewise, if I look at the
path that terminates in A,

149
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,950
that has a path length of 3.

150
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,300
So now I've got two choices.

151
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,710
A and B. I've got choices
that extend

152
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,170
beyond those two places.

153
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,640
So I'm always going to
extend the one that

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,250
has the shorter length.

155
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,450
So in this case, that would be
the path that goes from S to

156
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,380
A.

157
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,480
So if I from S to A, I don't
have to go to D. I can also go

158
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:33,429
to B. And if I go to B, then the
accumulated path length is

159
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,120
S, A, B. That's 7.

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
And know that we're talking now
about the path, like the

161
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,430
accumulated path length, that
we've traveled so far.

162
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,120
Last time we were talking
a lot about

163
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,220
distances to the goal.

164
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,340
Heuristic estimates of how
far we are from the goal.

165
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,500
Now we're doing exactly
the opposite.

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,570
We're not considering how
far we've got to go.

167
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,450
We're only thinking about how
far we've gone so far.

168
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,830
So now, repeating these
steps again.

169
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,660
I've got 7 and 5.

170
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,790
So I'll go over and consider
the choices that go through

171
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,360
the B node on the path S, B. And
that gives me S, B, A and

172
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,440
S, B, C. And what are
those path lengths?

173
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Well, let's see.

174
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,200
S, B, A would be 9.

175
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,620
And S, B,C would be 9.

176
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,740
And now the shortest path
is this one over here.

177
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,430
So I extend that.

178
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,280
I go S, A, B. S, A, B. The only
place I can go is C. That

179
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,150
adds another 4.

180
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,280
So that's 11.

181
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,690
And what do I know
about that path?

182
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,770
I don't have to take that
any further, right?

183
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,350
Because the path length, since
I've gone on that path

184
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,690
already, is equal to the path
length that Juana has told me

185
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,240
gets me to the goal.

186
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,110
So it'll be foolhardy to carry
on because, presuming that

187
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,810
these lengths are all
non-negative, I

188
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,270
can't do any better.

189
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,270
And I can't even do as well,
unless I've got a length that

190
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,440
has 0 length.

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,820
So now that I have that idea,
I can quickly finish up by

192
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,570
saying, well, let me consider
these two paths.

193
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,982
S, B, A can only go to D. And
if I go to D, that adds 3.

194
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:27,550
9 plus 3 is 12.

195
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,750
Nothing else can happen there
because that's 12 and I've got

196
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,470
a path of a goal that's 11.

197
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,500
C, I can only go to E. It's a
dead-end but I don't have to

198
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,640
think about that because I
know that the accumulated

199
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,730
distance along this
path is 6 plus 9.

200
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,640
That's 15.

201
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,740
So all of these need not be
extended any further because

202
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,090
their length, accumulated so
far, is equal to or less than

203
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,500
a length of a goal.

204
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,380
So I've checked the Oracle.

205
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,120
And although we're applying to
the same medical school, Juana

206
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,400
has told me the truth.

207
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,835
So now, unfortunately, Juana's
not always around.

208
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,690
And I don't always
have an Oracle.

209
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,030
So I'm going to have to have
some way of finding the

210
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,440
shortest path without
that Oracle

211
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,210
that I can check against.

212
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,190
Let's see.

213
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,440
What can I do?

214
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,430
Maybe I can do the same
thing I just did.

215
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,150
Always extend the shortest path
so far and hope that I

216
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,630
run into the goal
at some point.

217
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,800
And then I have to ask myself
the question how much extra

218
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,210
work did I need to do when
I don't have the Oracle?

219
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,760
Let's just try it and
see what happens.

220
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,400
You don't have that
path to start.

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
So I just have S. This
distance is 0.

222
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,590
I can go either to A or B.
If I go to A, I've got

223
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,080
a distance of 3.

224
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,410
Here, I've got a
distance of 5.

225
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,550
I'll extend the path that goes
S, A. That can either got to B

226
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,360
or D. Going to B or D
gives me 7 that way.

227
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,200
S, A, D gives me 6.

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,690
So looking across all of these
and extending the shortest

229
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:24,980
path so far takes me back over
to S, B. So I extend those.

230
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,510
S, B takes me to A or C.

231
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,550
And those, in turn, have
total accumulated path

232
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,880
lengths of 9 and 9.

233
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,390
Now the shortest one is S, A,
D. You see the pattern.

234
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,890
Now let's see.

235
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,930
I haven't found the goal yet.

236
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,720
So I can ask myself the question
is any of the work

237
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,190
that I've done so far wasted?

238
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,710
No because all of the paths
that I've got so far are

239
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,750
shorter than the path of the
goal because the goal

240
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,700
hasn't shown up.

241
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,230
So when I do my oracle checking
after I found the

242
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,220
goal, none of that work's
going to be wasted.

243
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,120
So in the end, I don't,
actually, need the Oracle.

244
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,760
I could just develop this
graph by extending the

245
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,390
shortest path, so far,
until I hit the goal.

246
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,030
And then, perhaps, do a little
remaining checking to make

247
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,610
sure that all the other paths
extend with a length that's

248
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,970
greater than the path
of the goal.

249
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,855
So if those words are confusing,
let's carry on with

250
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:30,000
the algorithm, and I think
it'll be clearer.

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,390
So let's see.

252
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,490
We've got the 7,
6, and two 9s.

253
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,530
We're going to extend
the one that's 6.

254
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,900
That gets this to the goal.

255
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,690
Boom, we've got it.

256
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,230
And we've got a path
length of 11.

257
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,040
Note, though, we can't quit
because we have to be sure

258
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,300
that all other paths
are longer than 11.

259
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,530
So now we have to carry on with
the same algorithm that

260
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,580
we started with.

261
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,630
The Oracle checking algorithm.

262
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,460
And when we do that, we look
for this shortest path, so

263
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,650
far, that has not
been extended.

264
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:08,360
That's B, S, A, B. That
goes to C. That's 11.

265
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,010
So we're done there.

266
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,600
A goes to D. That adds 3.

267
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,630
That's 12.

268
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,390
C goes to E. That adds 6.

269
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,050
That's 15.

270
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,020
And sure enough, we're done.

271
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,270
OK?

272
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:27,742
Elliot?

273
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,810
AUDIENCE: Does it know that
there's know that there isn't

274
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,110
a chance that you could have a
zero distance extension from

275
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,460
the [INAUDIBLE]?

276
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,302
PROFESSOR: The question is, does
it know that there's no

277
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:44,510
zero distance length
that's coming up.

278
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,400
That's an implementation
detail.

279
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,010
This guarantees you'll find a
path that's as short as any

280
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,320
that you can possibly find.

281
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,580
But there might be others if
they're zero-length lengths.

282
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
As long as they're non-negative

283
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,020
lengths, we're safe.

284
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,740
We've got a shortest path.

285
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,670
So that was easy.

286
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,560
And now we can repeat the
exercise with our more

287
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,490
complicated map of Cambridge.

288
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,000
First of all, let's do depth
first just to recall what that

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,610
looks like.

290
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,210
That is, certainly,
not a short path.

291
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,270
So let's try this idea, which,
by the way, bares the label

292
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,110
branch inbound.

293
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,740
Let's try branch inbound
on the same map.

294
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,040
And there it goes.

295
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,720
Each of those little flickers
is trying another path.

296
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,590
So you can see it's working
it's guts out to find the

297
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,840
shortest path.

298
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,870
It's almost there but it's
almost a pathological case.

299
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,410
Or it's almost doing
British Museum.

300
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,620
There it's finally found
the shortest path.

301
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,190
Now there are some things
we can ask about that.

302
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,910
But first of all, before I ask
anything about it, I'd like to

303
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,250
get the flow chart up on the
board because we're going to

304
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,100
decorate that flow chart,
a little bit, as we go.

305
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,140
So the first thing we do
is initialize queue.

306
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:31,310
Then we're going to test first
path on the queue.

307
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,650
Then we might be happy because
we might be done.

308
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,030
We might have a shortest
path to the goal.

309
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,650
Actually, that's not
quite true, is it?

310
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,070
We can't really quit until
every other path is it.

311
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,320
Well, that's interesting.

312
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,370
If the first element on the
queue gets us all the way to

313
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,500
the goal, and we sorted our
queue by path length, are we

314
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,680
through as soon as that first
element on the queue gets us

315
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,111
to the goal?

316
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah because every other
path must have been

317
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,230
sorted beyond it.

318
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,839
And therefore, it can't offer us
a shorter path to the goal.

319
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,550
So if the first path is a path
to the goal we're done.

320
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,190
Alas, it usually isn't.

321
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,490
So we'll extend first path.

322
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:39,790
We're going to put all those
extensions back on the queue,

323
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,290
and then we're going
to sort them.

324
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,340
So that's, pretty much, the
same as we did last time.

325
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,610
We're always going to put the
elements back on the queue.

326
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,150
We're going to look at the first
element the queue and

327
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,360
see if it's a winner.

328
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,430
If it is we're done.

329
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,520
If it's not, we're going
to extend it.

330
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,787
And then go back in here
and try again.

331
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,900
Well, sort of.

332
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,600
But we noted that this did a
awful lot of work because if

333
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,970
we look at those statistics
up there, it put 1,354

334
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,210
paths onto the queue.

335
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,210
That's the N queueing part.

336
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,690
And then it extended 835,000
paths that had come to the

337
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,940
front of the queue.

338
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:37,590
Now I'd like to give you an
aside because it's easy to get

339
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,890
confused about N queueing
and extending.

340
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,110
In all of the searches we did
last time, it would have been

341
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,660
perfectly reasonable to keep a
list of all the paths that we

342
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,444
had put onto the queue.

343
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,850
An N queueing list.

344
00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:00,540
And never add a path to our
queue if it terminates in a

345
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,820
node that some other path
terminate in that has already

346
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,110
gone to the queue.

347
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,820
What I said last time was let
us keep track of the things

348
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,900
that have been extended and
not extend them again.

349
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,830
So you can either keep track
of the nodes that have been

350
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,980
extended and not extend
them again.

351
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,290
Or look at the paths with nodes
that terminate, and

352
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,570
blah, blah, blah and been put on
the queue, the queued ones.

353
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,380
And not put things back
on the queue again.

354
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,535
And I think, last time, I may
have put a column in there

355
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:34,190
that said N queued.

356
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,090
It should have been extended.

357
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,840
Even though N queued worked last
time, only extended works

358
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,690
this time because we want to
be sure that anything we

359
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,070
extend is a short path.

360
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,370
So the N queued idea doesn't
work, at all, for these

361
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,910
optimal paths.

362
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,840
So now I want to come back over
here off the side bar and

363
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,945
say that we're keeping track
of all of the nodes, all of

364
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:07,040
the paths that end in nodes
unless they have already been

365
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,640
extended beyond that
particular place.

366
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,590
So we need to decorate our
algorithm here and say test

367
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:24,470
first path and extend
the first path

368
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,180
if not already extended.

369
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,740
Because you can see that in the
example I had, so far, we

370
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,130
did that same silliness that
we talked about last time.

371
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,030
We extended paths that
went through A more

372
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,310
than once, like so.

373
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,470
Would it ever make sense
to extend this path?

374
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,860
No because we've already
extended a path that got there

375
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,780
with less distance.

376
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,900
Will it ever make sense
to extend this path?

377
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,460
No because we've already
extended another path that

378
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,000
gets to be by a shorter
distance.

379
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,040
So if we keep an extended
list, we can add that to

380
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,130
branch inbound to
our advantage.

381
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,570
So let's see how that would work
on the classroom example.

382
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,920
And then we'll do Cambridge.

383
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,200
So this is bridge inbound,
plus an extended list.

384
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:37,260
And I do mean extended.

385
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,350
Not in the N queued list.

386
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,600
N queued list won't work here.

387
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,910
So let's see, I start off the
same way as I did before.

388
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:52,200
S goes to either A or B.
That's a length of 3.

389
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,980
That's a length of 5.

390
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:05,100
So I extend A. That goes to
either B or D. But B is as if

391
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,690
it wasn't there at all.

392
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,235
Oh, sorry.

393
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:09,485
Hang on.

394
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,990
B goes there.

395
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,140
And those path lengths
are 7 and 6.

396
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,260
And now I look around on the
board, and I say what is the

397
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,730
shortest path so far?

398
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,610
And it's B. So I extend that
to get to A and C with path

399
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,020
lengths of 9 and 9.

400
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,820
And what's the shortest
one next?

401
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,690
It's D. And that goes to G.
And the path length is 11.

402
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,640
And what's the shortest
one on the board?

403
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,010
The one that has to
be extended next.

404
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,690
That's this one that gets to B.
But I've already extended a

405
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,230
path that get to B. So I don't,

406
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,570
actually, do that extension.

407
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,801
So I've saved some work.

408
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,260
But I've got to go over here
and do these two now.

409
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,610
But wait.

410
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,770
I've already extended B. I've
already extended A, so I don't

411
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,930
have to do that one either.

412
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,340
The only one I have to do is
the one that goes to C. And

413
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,950
that those then to E with
a path length of 15.

414
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,670
And I'm done.

415
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,760
So if you compare this one with
a previous one, you can

416
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,450
see that there might be vast
areas of this tree that are

417
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,250
pruned away and don't have
to be examined all.

418
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,860
So now, just for the sake of
illustrating that, I would

419
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,740
like to keep track of just
one of those statistics.

420
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,260
The number of extensions.

421
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,420
So for this particular example,
case one, the number

422
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:35,330
of extensions was 835.

423
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,380
Why don't you see if you can
guess to yourself what it

424
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,360
would be if I use this concept
of an extended list.

425
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,670
See, I'm not going to extend
anything I've already extended

426
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,420
because it's guaranteed to have
a longer path length then

427
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,200
something that already got
to that same place.

428
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,790
So it makes no sense to do it.

429
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,520
So let me change the type to
branch-and-bound with an

430
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,750
extended list.

431
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,420
I'm going to turn the speed
down a little bit so

432
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,150
we can watch it.

433
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,830
It might take the rest
of the hour.

434
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,080
Who knows?

435
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,000
Still doing a lot of work.

436
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,445
Still examining a
lot of paths.

437
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,130
Well, look at that.

438
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:33,200
Instead of 835 extensions
it only did 38.

439
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
So that's a pretty substantial
savings.

440
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,360
And you would never not
want to do that.

441
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,370
So note that that's a layering
on top of branching out.

442
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,300
That's not a different
algorithm.

443
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,250
It's an adjustment improvement
to the algorithm, and it makes

444
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,500
it more efficient.

445
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,490
So this whole thing is
based on what I call

446
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,130
the dead horse principle.

447
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,980
As soon as we figure out that
a path that goes to a

448
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,640
particular place can't possibly
be the winning path,

449
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,830
we get rid of it, and don't
bother extending it.

450
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,330
It's a dead horse principle.

451
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:18,830
But if we look at this example,
what's the shortest

452
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,350
possible length of a
path that's already

453
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,600
gone from S to B?

454
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,204
What do you think, Tanya?

455
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,110
Well, first of all, it can't be
less than 5 because we've

456
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,390
already gone that distance.

457
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,300
So when I say what's the
shortest length of any path

458
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,090
that there could possibly be
that goes from S to D. We know

459
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,420
it's at least 5.

460
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,680
But can we say something
more about it?

461
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,140
Especially, when we look at
these airline distances, and

462
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,420
note that this airline distance
is 6, and that's a

463
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,150
little more than 7, and that's
a little more than 7.

464
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,400
So what do you think?

465
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,270
So it's gone from S to B, and
the question is what's the

466
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:13,370
shortest path that could
possibly be that had started

467
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,620
out going from S to B?

468
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,780
11 right?

469
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,690
Because we can't have a path
that's shorter than the

470
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,630
airline distance.

471
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,450
If there were a straight line
road from A to G, its length

472
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,320
would be 6.

473
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,630
But there isn't.

474
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,740
So that gives us a lower bound
on the distance that we have

475
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,840
along that path.

476
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,520
So we're using the accumulated
distance, plus the airline

477
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,980
distance, to give us a lower
bound on the path that we've

478
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,750
started off on that
goes from S to B.

479
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,730
Once again, let's solidify a
little bit by simulating the

480
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,320
search and seeing how
it turns out.

481
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,270
Not just I did last time, I'm
going to forget that I've got

482
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,510
an extended list.

483
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,840
I don't want to carry both of
those things around with me at

484
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,270
the same time.

485
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,620
So forget that we've got
an extended list.

486
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,020
We'll bring all those back
together a little later.

487
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,160
So we're going to forget
what we just did there.

488
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,340
And instead we're just going
to use this concept of an

489
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,705
airline distance and
see what happens.

490
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,910
As before we start with
a starting node.

491
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,640
We have two choices as always.

492
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,160
We can go to A or B. And the
accumulated distance, if we go

493
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,580
to A, is 3.

494
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,350
And then accumulated distance
if we go to B is 5.

495
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,280
But now we're going to add
in the airline distances.

496
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:08,140
So the airline distance from A
to G is a little more than 7,

497
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,060
which is 10 plus.

498
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,400
The airline distance from
B to G is exactly 6.

499
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,010
So that gives us 11.

500
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,070
And following the procedure
we've all been using already

501
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,120
so far, we're going to extend
the path that seems to have

502
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,560
the shortest potential.

503
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,390
Now it's the shortest potential
distance S to G. So

504
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,970
that must be this one here.

505
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:41,480
So from A we can go to B
or D. The accumulated

506
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,065
distance S, A, B, is 7.

507
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,550
The airline distance is 6,
so that's equal to 11.

508
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,890
Standard arithmetic 13.

509
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:05,280
The distance S, A, D. That is
6 plus a little more than 7.

510
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,090
So what's the accumulated
distance?

511
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,810
S, A, D is 3 plus 3 is 6.

512
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

513
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:22,925
PROFESSOR: What?

514
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,565
AUDIENCE: The airline distance
from D would be 5.

515
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:28,220
PROFESSOR: Would be 5, right.

516
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,230
So airline distance, in this
case, is the same as the

517
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,310
actual distance.

518
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,190
So the accumulated
distance is 6.

519
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,360
The actual distance is 5.

520
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,610
So that's equal to 11.

521
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,420
So now I've got two
11's on the board.

522
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,740
And simulating what we'd ask
you do on a quiz, we don't

523
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,520
know which of those is
going to be better.

524
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,300
They've got a tie score.

525
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,810
So what we're going to do is
we're going to choose the one

526
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,510
that's lexically least.

527
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:58,260
So B comes before D. So we'll
expand B. And that can go to

528
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:05,170
either A or C. And we have to
calculate the best possible

529
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,485
distance that goes along
those paths.

530
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:14,670
The accumulated distance
S, B, A. S, B, A is 9.

531
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,140
So that's 9 plus 7 plus.

532
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,700
That's 16 plus.

533
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,170
This has an accumulated
lead of distance of 9.

534
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,190
Also plus 7 plus.

535
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,060
Also 16 plus.

536
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,000
Well, now let's see.

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,940
Things are shaping up pretty
well because this one has the

538
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,000
lowest score so far.

539
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,760
We extend that to
G. And now the

540
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,470
accumulated distance is 11.

541
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,460
The airline distance
is 0, so that's 11.

542
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,840
And that's smaller than
everybody else.

543
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,040
So we've got.

544
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,700
So now compare this one with
our branch inbound graph.

545
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,370
And you see, once again, we've
done considerably less work.

546
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,850
And that, in many practical
cases, means that instead of

547
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:08,300
taking more than the remaining
lifetime of the universe to

548
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,760
complete the calculation, it can
happen in a few seconds.

549
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,440
But let's see how it works
on the example.

550
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,370
So I'm not going to use
the extended list.

551
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,810
I'm just going to use this idea
of using a lower bound on

552
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:26,710
the distance remaining,
the airline distance,

553
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,960
and see what happens.

554
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,980
So this time, the number
of extensions is 70.

555
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,710
So it didn't do quite as well
as working alone as the

556
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,680
extended list did
working alone.

557
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,160
So we immediately conclude that
the extended list is more

558
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,490
useful than using one of these
lower bound heuristics.

559
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,570
By the way, this is called
an admissible heuristic.

560
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:37,830
If the heuristic estimate is
guaranteed to be less than the

561
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,110
actual distance, that's called
an admissible heuristic.

562
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,230
Admissible because you can use
it for this kind of purpose.

563
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,940
So it looks like the day
extended list is a more useful

564
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,880
idea than the admissible idea.

565
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,690
Right?

566
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,410
What do you think about
that, Brett?

567
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,195
Am I hacking?

568
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:00,945
Am I joking?

569
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,580
AUDIENCE: I think you're
judging prematurely.

570
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,180
PROFESSOR: Why am I judging
prematurely?

571
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,390
What do you think it
might depend on?

572
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,055
AUDIENCE: The fact that we're
using extensions and the

573
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,436
extended list pretty much
guarantees you can only extend

574
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:12,054
each node once.

575
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:15,945
PROFESSOR: Well, Brett has sad
something unintelligible that

576
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:17,600
I can't think how to repeat.

577
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,195
What he meant to say,
though, was that--

578
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:22,360
[LAUGHTER]

579
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,770
PROFESSOR: --in these cases,
it almost always depends on

580
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,930
the problem itself.

581
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,670
If you change the problem, you
may get a different result.

582
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,370
So why don't we change the
problem and see if we get a

583
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,480
different result?

584
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,040
So instead of starting on the
extreme left, let's start in

585
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,380
the middle and see
what happens.

586
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,880
So I'll readjust my starting
position to be right there.

587
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,320
Oops, that's the wrong
adjustment.

588
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,840
And we might as well start
by getting our baseline

589
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,315
branch-and-bound without
anything.

590
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,580
And for that one, maybe, we'll
speed it up a little bit.

591
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,000
So that gives us
57 extensions.

592
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,250
It's an easier problem.

593
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,080
So let's try it with the
admissible heuristic.

594
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,210
That went too fast.

595
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,610
Wow, still pretty fast.

596
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,860
Six extensions.

597
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:43,139
What do you think this
number's going to be?

598
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,989
Closer to six or closer to 57?

599
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,630
Better than six?

600
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,370
Worse than six?

601
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,889
Well, let's think.

602
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,100
What we're going to do is we're
going to just not repeat

603
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,080
any movements through
the same node again.

604
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,360
But it's not going to
do something very

605
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,085
important for us.

606
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:04,350
It's not going to keep us out
of the left side because it

607
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,930
has no idea of the remaining
airline distance to the goal.

608
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:19,380
So let's see if that's
true It sure is.

609
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,155
Look at that.

610
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:23,100
It is, foolishly, spending
a lot of its' time doing

611
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,090
something we would never do.

612
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,740
Namely, looking over there
on the left side.

613
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,370
So this time, the number
of extensions is 35.

614
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,860
So in case two, the admissible
heuristic

615
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,140
does very much better.

616
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,920
In case one, the extension
thing does much better.

617
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,450
But wait a minute, would we ever
not want to use both at

618
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,700
the same time?

619
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,660
We wouldn't want to use just
one of these, right?

620
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,230
They both have the possibility
of doing us a lot of good.

621
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,190
So maybe if we put them in
harness together, we'll get

622
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,170
something that's even better.

623
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,350
And when we do that--

624
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,870
see here, the extended list
is a layer on top

625
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,890
of branch and bound.

626
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,200
The admissible heuristic
is another layer on top

627
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,250
of branch and bound.

628
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,490
If we put those together, we get
something called A star.

629
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,800
So A star is just branch and
bound, plus an extended list,

630
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,290
plus and admissible heuristic.

631
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,750
So let's go back to our original
problem and try A

632
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,000
star on that.

633
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,410
We're running this at a pretty
slow speed because we're

634
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,190
expecting it to be a lot more
efficient than the original

635
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,890
branch and bound.

636
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,560
And sure enough it is.

637
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,470
The number of extensions
is 27.

638
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,910
So look at that.

639
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,950
A lot better than either of
those working independently.

640
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,750
Now I can stick the thing in
the center and see what

641
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,000
happens then.

642
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,490
So in this particular case,
the extended list didn't,

643
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,090
actually, help us because our
admissible heuristic was

644
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,790
channeling us so tightly
toward the

645
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,360
goal it didn't matter.

646
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,470
So it all depends on the nature
of the space that

647
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,160
you're trying to explore.

648
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,870
By the way, you know how
the whole works, right?

649
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,210
So what you want to do is
you want to extend the

650
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,120
first path and sort.

651
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,120
But not just by accumulated
distance.

652
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:45,550
Sort by accumulated distance
plus admissible heuristic.

653
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,090
But what are the
theoreticians?

654
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,550
You must be complaining.

655
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,440
Sort's expensive.

656
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,740
Do we actually need to sort?

657
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,960
No, we don't actually
need to sort.

658
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,900
What do we to do?

659
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,141
AUDIENCE: We just need to keep
track of what's the minimum.

660
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:09,946
PROFESSOR: We just need
to keep track

661
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:10,530
of what's the minimum.

662
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,130
So we don't need to, actually,
do that sort.

663
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,670
That's an unnecessary
computation.

664
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,770
So instead, we can test, not
the first path but the

665
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,020
shortest path.

666
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,620
And now you have it.

667
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,430
Now you have the whole
of A star.

668
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,650
And now you can go home, but I
don't think you should because

669
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:42,090
I'm about to show you that this
idea of admissibility,

670
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,410
actually, leads to certain screw
cases that we're very

671
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,340
fond of asking about on exams.

672
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,280
So it turns out that the
admissible heuristic, in

673
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,400
certain circumstances, could
get you into trouble.

674
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,940
It doesn't look like it could
because, logically, nothing

675
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,480
I've said seems strange
or questionable.

676
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,150
But that's because I've been
working with a map.

677
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,100
And it turns out that if you
work with a map then

678
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,500
admissibility is a perfectly
sound way of

679
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,710
doing an optimal search.

680
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,650
But, Travis, is search
just about maps?

681
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,130
No, search is not
just about maps.

682
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,545
So we may have non-Euclidean
arrangements that will cause

683
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:22,710
us trouble.

684
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,815
So I'd like to illustrate that
with the following example.

685
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,100
It's not going to be a large
map or a large graph.

686
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:43,866
S, then go up here to A or
down here to B. Then they

687
00:39:43,866 --> 00:39:51,650
merge at C. And then they go
out here to the goal, G.

688
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:58,810
And the actual distances
are 1, 1, 1, and 10.

689
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,390
And over here, we'll
make that 100.

690
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,340
So it's a kind of oddly
constructed map, but it's

691
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,240
there because we need a
pathological case to

692
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,510
illustrate the idea.

693
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,590
Now that's the actual
distances.

694
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,090
And if we did branch and down
with an extended list,

695
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,250
everything would
work just fine.

696
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:17,715
But we're not.

697
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,530
We're going to use an admissible
heuristic.

698
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,760
And we're going to say that
this guy has an estimated

699
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,480
distance to the goal of 100.

700
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,830
This guy is 0.

701
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,240
And this guy is 0.

702
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,500
Now, 0 is always an
underestimate of the actual

703
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,600
distance to the goal, right?

704
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,970
So I'm always free to use 0.

705
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,350
Is that 100 OK?

706
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,400
Yeah because the actual
distances is 101, so it's less

707
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,650
than that the actual distance.

708
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,950
So it's OK as an admissible
heuristic.

709
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:53,570
So these numbers that I put up
here, together, constitute an

710
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,300
admissible heuristic set of
estimates to the goal.

711
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:06,370
So now, let's just simulate A
star and see what happens.

712
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,170
So first of all, you start with
S, and that can either go

713
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:20,130
to A or B. The actual distance
is 1 plus an estimate on the

714
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,570
remaining distance.

715
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,410
That gives us 100 plus 100.

716
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,860
That's equal to 101.

717
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,160
If we go to B instead, the
actual distance is 1 plus the

718
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,190
heuristic's distance is 0,
so that's equal to 1.

719
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,870
OK, good.

720
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,140
So now we know that we
always extend the

721
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,020
shortest path so far.

722
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,020
Did I goof this, or are
you asking a question?

723
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

724
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:51,730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, when I say
actual, it's the actual

725
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,895
distance that you've traveled.

726
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,650
AUDIENCE: But that's
[INAUDIBLE].

727
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,250
PROFESSOR: So wait a second.

728
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,123
If I go from S to A,
the actual distance

729
00:42:00,123 --> 00:42:01,338
I've traveled is 1.

730
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,282
AUDIENCE: I meant like,
does the map--

731
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:06,780
PROFESSOR: So now I'm taking
the sum of the actual

732
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,735
distance, plus the estimated
distance to go.

733
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,474
AUDIENCE: All right.

734
00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:10,896
I'm just wondering if the
original map has to be

735
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,792
[INAUDIBLE].

736
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:17,270
PROFESSOR: See this
is not a map.

737
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,630
She was asking if the map has to
be geometrically accurate.

738
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,480
See, this could be a model of
something that's not a map.

739
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,230
And so, I'm free to put any
numbers on those links that I

740
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,520
want, including estimates, as
long as they're underestimates

741
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,250
of the distance along
the lengths.

742
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,150
So this tells me that my
estimated distance

743
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,810
here, so far, is 1.

744
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,530
So I'll, surely, go down here
to C. And if I go to C, then

745
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:50,890
my accumulated distance is 11.

746
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,190
And my estimate of the remaining
distance is 0.

747
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,505
So that's a total of 11.

748
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,270
So now I'm following my
heuristic again and saying

749
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,130
what's the shortest path on
a base of the accumulated

750
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,180
distance plus the estimated
distance?

751
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,080
Here, the accumulated
distance plus the

752
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,490
estimated distance is 101.

753
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,600
Here, it's only 11.

754
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,420
So plainly, I extend this guy.

755
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,300
And that gets me to the goal.

756
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,980
And the total accumulated
distance is now 111 plus 0

757
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,230
equals 111.

758
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,750
And that's not the shortest
path, but wait.

759
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,780
I still have to do my
checking, right?

760
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,900
I have to extend A. I when I
extend A, I get to B. And now,

761
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,710
when I get to B that
way, my accumulated

762
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,230
distance is 2 plus my--

763
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:53,920
oh, sorry.

764
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,640
S, A, C.

765
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,170
My accumulate distance it 2.

766
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,910
My estimated distance is 0,
so that's equal to 2.

767
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,150
So I'm OK because I'm still
going to extend

768
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,810
to this guy, right?

769
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,950
Wrong.

770
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,210
I've already extended
that guy.

771
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,530
So I'm hosed.

772
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,640
I won't find the shortest
path because I'm

773
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,740
going to stop there.

774
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,085
And I'm going to stop there
because this is an admissible

775
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:24,450
heuristic and that's not good
enough unless it's a map.

776
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,620
It's not good enough for this
particular case because this

777
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,210
is not geometric.

778
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,900
This cannot be done as
a map on a plane.

779
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,850
So that's a situation where what
I've talked to you about,

780
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,730
so far, works with
branch-and-bound.

781
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,070
Works with branch-and -bound
plus an extended list.

782
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:45,210
But doesn't work when we added
an admissible heuristic.

783
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,020
So if we're going to do this in
general, we need something

784
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,480
stronger than admissibility,
which works only on maps.

785
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,590
And so the flourish that I'll
tell you about here in the

786
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:10,780
last few seconds of today's
lecture is to add a refinement

787
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,960
as follows.

788
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,590
So far, we've got
admissibility.

789
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,410
And if we want to write this
down in a kind of mathematical

790
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,680
notation, we could say that
it's admissible if the

791
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,500
estimated distance between any
node X and the goal is less

792
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,440
than or equal to the
actual distance

793
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,490
between X and the goal.

794
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:40,230
That's the definition
of admissible.

795
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,350
As long as heuristic does
that it's admissible.

796
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,250
And A star works
if it's a map.

797
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,860
But for that kind of situation
where it's not a map we need a

798
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,445
stronger condition, which
is called consistency.

799
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,100
And what that says is that the
distance between X and the

800
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:04,940
goal minus the distance between
some other node in the

801
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:11,010
goal, Y. Take the absolute
value of that.

802
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:13,950
That has to be less than or
equal to the actual distance

803
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:18,700
between X and Y.

804
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:24,280
So this heuristic satisfy the
consistency condition?

805
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,600
Well, let's see.

806
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,980
Here the guess is 100.

807
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,660
Here it's 0.

808
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,590
So the absolute difference
is 100.

809
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,440
But the actual distance
is only 2.

810
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,170
So it satisfies admissibility,
but it doesn't satisfy

811
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,495
consistency.

812
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,320
And it doesn't work.

813
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,880
So you can almost be guaranteed
we'll give you a

814
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,830
situation where if you
use an admissible

815
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,490
heuristic you'll lose.

816
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,290
And if you use a consistent
heuristic, you'll still win.

817
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,570
So how can we bring this
back into the fold?

818
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:01,950
Well, we can't use
that heuristic.

819
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,480
It's no good.

820
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,690
But if this heuristic estimate
of the goal were 2, then we'd

821
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:15,100
be OK because then it would
still be admissible.

822
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,310
But it would also
be consistent.

823
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,565
So the bottom line is that you
now know something you didn't

824
00:47:20,565 --> 00:47:24,000
know when you started out
two lectures ago.

825
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,450
You now know how MapQuest and
all of its' descendents work.

826
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,470
Now you can find an optimal
path, as well as a

827
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,390
heuristically good path.

828
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,795
You see that if you don't do
anything other than branch and

829
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:37,510
bound it can be extremely
expensive.

830
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,760
And you can even invent
pathological cases where it's

831
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,890
exponential and the distance
to the goal.

832
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,730
So because it can be so
computationally horrible, you

833
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,360
want to use every advantage
you can, which, generally,

834
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,470
involves using an
extended list.

835
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,790
As well as--

836
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,870
no laptops, please.

837
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:57,510
It still holds.

838
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,930
No smoking, no drinking,
and no laptops.

839
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,200
So you're going to use all
the muscles you can.

840
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,180
And those muscles include using
an extended list and an

841
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,410
admissible or consistent
heuristic, depending on the

842
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,350
circumstances.

843
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,880
And so, I think we'll conclude
there since our time is up.

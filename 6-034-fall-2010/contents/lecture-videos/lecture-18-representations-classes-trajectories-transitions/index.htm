<p><span m="15220">PATRICK WINSTON: We might wonder a little bit about the</span> <span m="19340">nature of human intelligence, and we might reflect a little</span> <span m="24540">bit on the kind of intelligence we've been</span> <span m="26230">talking about in the past few weeks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="28310">It's been an intelligence of sorts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="31160">Those programs, support vector machines, boosting, they can</span> <span m="33980">do really smart things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="36030">But the peculiar thing about systems that use those methods</span> <span m="38710">is that those systems don't have any idea about what</span> <span m="43770">they're doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="45260">They don't know anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="47380">So they don't give us very much of an insight into the</span> <span m="49810">nature of human intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="52720">And, after all, I'd like to have a model of human</span> <span m="54500">intelligence because, let's face it, we're the smartest</span> <span m="58000">things around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="59830">So there are lots of ways to approach that question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="62760">And we'll approach that question first from a</span> <span m="68090">evolutionary point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="70560">Some scientists believe, me for instance, that we have a</span> <span m="76990">family tree that looks about like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90110">Too small to see much of that, but the main point is that we</span> <span m="93970">haven't been around very long.</span> </p>
<p><span m="96360">We humans have been around maybe 200,000 years, and the</span> <span m="100470">dinosaurs died out 60 million years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="104030">So in the blink of an eye, we seem to have, more or less,</span> <span m="107890">taken over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="110500">When you look at that family tree on a scale where you can</span> <span m="114590">see it, one of the characteristics is increasing</span> <span m="117960">brain size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="122380">There we are on the left, chimpanzee on the right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="126980">Clearly, mostly mouth, not to much brain in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="131300">That one down below is a reconstruction of one of those</span> <span m="135040">pithecus type bipedal apes from about 4 million</span> <span m="140380">years ago or so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="142680">So we became bipedal a long time before we</span> <span m="145770">had much of a brain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="147810">So you might think, well, maybe brain size has a lot to</span> <span m="150980">do with it, and I suppose it does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="154079">So we can plot brain volume of our ancestors versus time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="160700">So the picture I just showed you was from about 3 million</span> <span m="162950">years ago, I guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="165740">And then on the upper right hand corner, oh, that's not</span> <span m="168530">just us, that's also the Neanderthals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="171500">Their brains might have been slightly bigger than ours.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174750">So it isn't just brain size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="178020">Here's what that guy looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="180660">That's a Neanderthal, of course, on the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="184930">And that's one of us on the right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="186680">Some conspicuous differences, big heads, the rib cage is</span> <span m="192630">kind of conical in shape, a large pelvis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="197130">People like to make a lot of speculations about how they</span> <span m="199670">must have moved around.</span> </p>
<p><span m="202031">But one thing is plain, they didn't amount to much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="206062">They could make stone tools, but those stone tools didn't</span> <span m="209300">change much over tens of thousands of years.</span> </p>
<p><span m="213170">And that was pretty much the story with us too, until</span> <span m="216240">something happened, probably in southern Africa, probably</span> <span m="220400">in a group of individuals, maybe less than 1,000.</span> </p>
<p><span m="225500">And what's the evidence for that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="226520">The evidence for that is mostly--</span> <span m="228840">comes from DNA studies with a lot of probabilistic</span> <span m="234420">assumptions, and Monte Carlo simulations, but it seems</span> <span m="237850">among the competing hypothesis for how we came to populate</span> <span m="240640">the world, it seems that there was a group of us, homo</span> <span m="243290">sapiens, in Southern Africa that got something that nobody</span> <span m="246820">else had and the highest probability scenario is that</span> <span m="251920">we quickly took over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="254870">That population of homo sapiens dominated the rest,</span> <span m="258560">went out of Africa, and within the blink of an eye did that</span> <span m="261970">sort of stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="265300">What's that sort of stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="268330">Those two paintings are from Lascaux about</span> <span m="271120">25,000 years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="275190">Paleoanthropologists, like Tattersall, take that as plain</span> <span m="277870">evidence that there was symbolic thought on the people</span> <span m="280190">who were around at that time, us homo sapiens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="283710">The head is a carving of a mastodon tusk of a woman</span> <span m="289120">25,000 years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="291110">Also, plainly symbolic, people are making a lot of jewelry</span> <span m="296750">and doing self adornment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="297860">The Neanderthals never seemed to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="300130">That jewelry making seems to have gone back to Southern</span> <span m="303180">Africa, maybe 70,000 years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="306410">People were puncturing seashells and using them as</span> <span m="309060">necklaces, apparently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="311990">So something happened, and the paleoanthropologists, who</span> <span m="315350">write fascinating stuff, don't quite know how to talk about</span> <span m="318110">it other than to say it looks like we</span> <span m="319360">became somehow symbolic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="321820">And somehow that has something to do with language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="325780">So if you talk to Noam Chomsky he will say--</span> <span m="330280">let me get this precise, this is near his</span> <span m="332020">quotation as I can get.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334450">He thinks it was the ability to take two concepts and put</span> <span m="337920">them together to form a third concept without disturbing the</span> <span m="341400">original concepts and without limit, and each</span> <span m="344850">part of that's important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="347030">The without limit part is what separates us from species that</span> <span m="350100">might be able to do that a little bit, but we can do it</span> <span m="353659">without any apparent limit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357210">So that's a linguist speaking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="358760">He talks a lot about the merge operation, and</span> <span m="360910">combinators and language--</span> <span m="363080">using terms foreign to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="364680">Better not use the term "combinator," it's kind of a</span> <span m="366550">computer science term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="368810">But whatever it is, it seemed to happen about that time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="373210">It didn't happen slowly and proportion to brain size, it</span> <span m="376980">seemed to happen all of a sudden in consequence of a</span> <span m="380460">brain that had grown big enough to be an enablement but</span> <span m="384520">the capability was not what pulled</span> <span m="387480">evolution in that direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="389710">So, I believe, that whatever that was, that capability,</span> <span m="395000">enabled humans, us humans, to tell and understand stories,</span> <span m="401540">and that's what separates us from the other primates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="405150">That ability to--</span> <span m="406300">The symbolic ability, whatever it is, enabled storytelling</span> <span m="411280">and understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="412070">And that's what all education is about and that's why our</span> <span m="414770">species is special.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416880">So what we're going to talk about today is something you</span> <span m="421830">might think of as an instantiation of that</span> <span m="423720">hypothesis, one way of thinking about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="426740">And it's a way of thinking about what the linguists would</span> <span m="428920">call the inner language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431090">It's not the language with which we communicate, it's the</span> <span m="434240">language with which we think, which is closely related to</span> <span m="438660">the language with which we communicate, but may not be</span> <span m="441840">quite the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="444090">So many of you are bilingual.</span> </p>
<p><span m="446900">Chris is bilingual.</span> </p>
<p><span m="448200">Chris, have you ever had the experience of remembering that</span> <span m="450640">someone said something to you, but not remembering what</span> <span m="453860">language they used?</span> </p>
<p><span m="456658">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="462450">PATRICK WINSTON: How about [? you, Sian, ?] have you had</span> <span m="463250">that experience?</span> </p>
<p><span m="464677">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="465870">PATRICK WINSTON: What?</span> </p>
<p><span m="466420">STUDENT: I always [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="470121">PATRICK WINSTON: [INAUDIBLE] experience of having--</span> <span m="472490">David, have you ever had that experience of remembering some</span> <span m="475010">conversation but not remembering the language in</span> <span m="477140">which it was cast?</span> </p>
<p><span m="478659">STUDENT: Well, you remember something you usually don't</span> <span m="480046">know which language it was in anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="481894">PATRICK WINSTON: You usually don't remember.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483880">That's a common view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485480">You remember something was said, that there was a</span> <span m="487110">conversation that had some content, but if it's with a</span> <span m="491640">speaker of your own language and your embedded in another</span> <span m="494250">place, you often don't remember what language the</span> <span m="498340">conversation was in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="500110">Is that right, [? Wana, ?] you remember things like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="502500">Not sure?</span> </p>
<p><span m="503912">STUDENT: People who [INAUDIBLE] speak in a certain</span> <span m="505941">language, so--</span> <span m="507520">PATRICK WINSTON: Sometimes you don't have that confusion, she</span> <span m="509060">says, because you always speak to particular people in a</span> <span m="512400">particular language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="513330">But many people report that they have that experience of</span> <span m="516169">not remembering which language something was said in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="520289">Well, OK, so what are we going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="522590">We need an inner language, and maybe we can start just by</span> <span m="525610">saying, let's have something that looks sort</span> <span m="528690">of familiar to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="529980">We have an object and it's supported by some other</span> <span m="535290">objects, so those are support relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="542680">That's one example of what we might call a semantic net.</span> </p>
<p><span m="545850">It's a network that's got nodes and links, it's got--</span> <span m="550940">it has some meaning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="552640">That's where the word "semantic" comes from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="554790">Well, we might have another example that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="558760">There's Macbeth, there's Duncan, and Macbeth murders</span> <span m="570640">Duncan, then we also know, somehow, there's a kill</span> <span m="579870">involved as a consequence, and then ultimately,</span> <span m="583720">Duncan has a property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="593500">And that property is the property of being dead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="598460">So there's another semantic net recording something that</span> <span m="601530">happens in Shakespeare's Macbeth plot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="606030">Now, we can decorate that a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="607880">So as to get a couple of other concepts in play.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611200">First of all, the thing we've got already is we've got</span> <span m="614090">combinators.</span> </p>
<p><span m="622520">Then combinators.</span> </p>
<p><span m="626570">Well, a fancy name for those links that connect the nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="630590">Another thing we've got is an opportunity for connecting the</span> <span m="634410">links themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="636370">So the murder sort of implies the kill, and the kill leads</span> <span m="641920">us to conclude that the victim is dead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="645170">So that is treating the links themselves as objects that can</span> <span m="650720">be the subject or object of other links.</span> </p>
<p><span m="654240">So we call that process "reification."</span> <span m="664630">Now, in artificial intelligence, semantic nets</span> <span m="668100">we're all over the early work, but if you have a big network</span> <span m="671460">that covers the wall you need some way of putting a</span> <span m="674780">spotlight on some pieces of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="677810">So Marvin Minsky put a lot of technical content into that</span> <span m="682580">idea and created the notion of--</span> <span m="686830">a notion that deserves another color here--</span> <span m="690210">he suggested that we need a localization process, so we</span> <span m="693850">have frames, so-called frames or templates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="698110">And a frame for this murder action might be that there's a</span> <span m="701340">murder frame that has an agent and has a victim, and the</span> <span m="711450">agent is Macbeth, and the victim is Duncan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="722950">So that's a way of putting a localization layer on top of</span> <span m="733780">what we've got so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="736230">Later on, I'll add sequence to that list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738900">So this is where it rested for a long time, and in some</span> <span m="741820">sense, still rests there because as soon as you've got</span> <span m="745300">combinators, you've got something</span> <span m="747110">that's pretty much universal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="750690">You can do anything with it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753690">The trouble is it's sort of down at the bit level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757060">It's like assembly code.</span> </p>
<p><span m="759390">It doesn't have, as a concept, enough organization to help</span> <span m="764230">you go to the next level of achievement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="768360">There's also a little problem here that deserves also, some</span> <span m="773760">mention, and that is that we have, over this whole thing,</span> <span m="780770">the problem of parasitic semantics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="785910">Parasitic semantics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="795318">A kind of ugliness that surrounds this whole concept</span> <span m="798320">because when we look at a diagram like that, and we say,</span> <span m="801360">oh, Macbeth murdered Duncan, that means</span> <span m="803260">Duncan's the victim.</span> </p>
<p><span m="804880">We know there must have been a motive, maybe Macbeth wanted</span> <span m="807720">to be king.</span> </p>
<p><span m="808190">Well, we know all that stuff, and there's a tendency to</span> <span m="811810">project that knowing into the machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815530">If you're going to play with your telephone, please leave.</span> </p>
<p><span m="821670">So if we project meaning into that that's our understanding</span> <span m="831870">that's not the machine's understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="833750">So much of the meaning can be said to be parasitic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="838700">We're the parasite, and we're projecting</span> <span m="840740">the into that thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="842325">Putting that diagram into some machine form doesn't mean the</span> <span m="845110">machine knows anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="847710">It might be able to conclude some things, but it's</span> <span m="850140">understanding is not grounded in any kind of contact with</span> <span m="853300">the physical world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="854880">So we have to worry a lot about that and where</span> <span m="858310">philosophers would stop there and go off and write a few</span> <span m="860460">books on the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862340">But we're not philosophers so we're going to just mention</span> <span m="864470">the problem and go barreling ahead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="867700">So we need to use this notion of semantic net, and we have</span> <span m="871220">to ask ourselves some questions about what elements</span> <span m="873200">of the inner language are most useful and yet it might be</span> <span m="875660">very complicated, but here's usefulness number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="879960">The notion of classification.</span> </p>
<p><span m="883330">So we know about stuff, and we know about,</span> <span m="886660">for example, pianos.</span> </p>
<p><span m="892620">And we know about tools.</span> </p>
<p><span m="897160">And we know about maps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902300">But we know about those things on different levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="906010">So say I'm thinking about a tool, do you have a very good</span> <span m="911120">image of what I'm talking about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="912960">The answer has to be no because the notion of a tool</span> <span m="915690">is very vague, so it's hard to form a picture of</span> <span m="918960">what that's all about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="921360">On the other hand, if I said I'm thinking about a mac.</span> </p>
<p><span m="924720">Well, this is interesting because there's lexical</span> <span m="926990">ambiguity there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927670">You don't know if I'm talking about the Apple type Mac or</span> <span m="931970">the apple type Mac, or should I say the</span> <span m="935400">fruit or the computer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="938800">So there's lexical ambiguity there at two levels or more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943660">But let's fill this in a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="947260">If I know I'm talking about a piano, you can form a picture</span> <span m="949010">of that so that seems to be on a more detailed level where</span> <span m="951100">you can do hallucination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="952750">At a higher level you have just a musical instrument.</span> </p>
<p><span m="958730">And I can give you a tool to think about by writing hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="966260">And if I'm going to have a mac, it's</span> <span m="968060">going to be an apple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970890">And in this case, I want you to think about a fruit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="975480">And down here, I can be more specific about</span> <span m="977650">these things too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="979850">I can add a slight refinement of detail and say, I'm</span> <span m="984330">thinking about one of these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="985723">Do you know what this is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="988014">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="989490">PATRICK WINSTON: No, it's not a mere hammer, it's a</span> <span m="992070">ball-peen hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="994590">In some circles, it's called a ladies hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="996290">I don't know why.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998600">But it's--</span> <span m="1000050">What's it for?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1002580">Most people buy it mostly because it's</span> <span m="1004420">small and light weight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1006060">But, in fact, it's for metal working.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1008570">It's for taking a piece of sheet metal and pounding it</span> <span m="1010810">out into an ashtray or something</span> <span m="1012630">or for seating rivets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1013870">It's a metal worker's hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016530">So you might not have known about that before but now, at</span> <span m="1018450">least, you have a word to hang that knowledge on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020300">It's a ball peen hammer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1026010">So we have various levels here, going from very specific</span> <span m="1030059">to very general.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1031800">And we can even go to a level of specificity for pianos by</span> <span m="1035520">saying we've got a Bosendorfer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1043430">Why is a Bosendorfer special?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1047950">I mean, is it like a Baldwin?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1051240">Something's [INAUDIBLE], Yoka--</span> <span m="1057150">Lots of piano types, what's special?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058710">You see, you don't know because unless you play the</span> <span m="1062110">piano, and probably unless you're a serious piano player</span> <span m="1065290">you don't know that a Bosendorfer--</span> <span m="1067082">Ariel, you know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1068658">STUDENT: I think its supposed to have an extra octave at the</span> <span m="1071950">bottom, black keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1072610">Pretty cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1073600">PATRICK WINSTON: It's got some extra keys at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1076580">And most people don't know that unless they're serious</span> <span m="1078240">about the piano.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1079350">Some professional piano players, when they're</span> <span m="1081160">confronted with a Bosendorfer have to have someone cover</span> <span m="1084110">those keys because it screws up their peripheral vision,</span> <span m="1087790">and hit the wrong key.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1089420">Because they're not used to having those</span> <span m="1090410">extra keys at the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1092780">So that's a little detail but the Bosendorfer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1095365">So you can make a kind of graph, and you can say, let's</span> <span m="1099470">go from low, very general, to a basic level,</span> <span m="1111140">to a specific level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1116170">So it is the case in human knowledge that that graph has</span> <span m="1121550">a tendency to look sort of like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1129030">So here's tool, here's hammer, here's ball peen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1133650">So that level, where you have a big jump, that's the general</span> <span m="1137540">to basic level of transition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1141580">So that basic level is probably there because that's</span> <span m="1144070">the level on which we hang a huge amount of our knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1148090">We know a lot about pianos, and it all seems to be hanging</span> <span m="1152200">on that word piano, which gives us</span> <span m="1154070">power with the concept.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1156980">So that's example number one of an element</span> <span m="1160680">of our inner language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1161600">The ability to assemble things into hierarchies like that,</span> <span m="1165860">and hang knowledge about those objects on the elements in</span> <span m="1170740">that hierarchy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175220">Well, given that you have elements in the hierarchy, how</span> <span m="1177790">do you talk about them?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1178650">Well, I like to consider the possibility, just for the sake</span> <span m="1181740">of illustration, that you're thinking about a car crashing</span> <span m="1184750">into a wall.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1186750">So you've got things to think about like the speed of the</span> <span m="1190220">car, the distance to the wall, and the condition of the car.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1208790">And you've got the period before the crash, during the</span> <span m="1212110">crash, and after the crash.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1214650">So you might want to think about how to talk about those</span> <span m="1218390">objects in those three time periods.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1223790">So we can do that with a vocabulary of change and we do</span> <span m="1230410">that because we believe that most of human thinking is</span> <span m="1234400">thinking about change causing change.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1237360">And that flies in the face of what we learned as engineers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1241070">Because in engineering, we learn about state, and once</span> <span m="1244995">you know the state of the system, you know everything</span> <span m="1247900">you need to know in order to predict the future.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1250020">The trouble is, in our heads, thinking about everything</span> <span m="1253640">there is in the world, including the current phase of</span> <span m="1256007">the moon, is too much stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1258530">So mostly, our thinking, we think, is hinging on the idea</span> <span m="1263950">that change leads to change.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1266530">So that's why we have a vocabulary of change.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1269620">So in the period before the crash, the speed of the car is</span> <span m="1274460">not changing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1275090">There's a little notation for not change, no delta.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1278600">The distance to the wall, that's decreasing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282790">The condition of the car, that's not changing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1287370">Then, the car hits the wall.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1290210">So the speed of the car disappears, the distance to</span> <span m="1293810">the wall disappears, and the condition of the car will</span> <span m="1297950">change dramatically.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1300010">Finally, after the crash is over, the speed of the car</span> <span m="1304110">does not appear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1305740">The distance to the wall does not change, and the condition</span> <span m="1310520">of the car also does not change.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1313550">So that's hinting at a vocabulary of change, and its</span> <span m="1317020">use, which will be the second element in our development of</span> <span m="1320470">a vocabulary of ways in which we might have constructed are</span> <span m="1324950">inner language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1326700">So this a particular idea, that's classification.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330800">This is transition, and a system that purports to</span> <span m="1337930">understand stories with a heavy emphasis on this notion</span> <span m="1340850">of transition and we believe, that is to say, I think, that</span> <span m="1345450">that vocabulary has to have decrease, increase, change,</span> <span m="1351880">appear, and disappear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355000">So there are 10 things you can have in such diagrams.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1359910">I've done five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1361070">That's because, for each of those, there's a not</span> <span m="1367110">variation on that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1370070">So with a vocabulary of 10 things can go a long way</span> <span m="1372270">toward helping to describe things that are in process of</span> <span m="1375250">change and making transition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1376980">And we have a lot of those words in our vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1379200">We use those words a lot in our vocabulary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380680">They seem heavily connected with vision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1383380">Our friend appeared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1385700">The cat disappeared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387580">The speed increased.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389910">So this is a description of a crash.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396090">In terms of those kinds of elements, now, I say to you,</span> <span m="1400430">how does a camera work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1403410">Well, I could say the camera works because a photon crashes</span> <span m="1411160">into a photo receptor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1414700">So when I say a photon crashes into a photo receptors, why am</span> <span m="1417450">I saying that, and how does it help?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420230">I'm saying that and it helps because it's the same pattern</span> <span m="1422890">of change you already know about when you talk about a</span> <span m="1426390">car crashing into a wall.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1428560">How does that work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1430180">The speed of the photon, the distance of the photon to the</span> <span m="1443790">receptor, and the condition of the receptor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1453680">So analogies like that are very much of the core of what</span> <span m="1456720">we think about all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1458700">Really then, there is representation number two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1463630">Number one is class, number two is transition, and now,</span> <span m="1467040">you're ready for number three, which is trajectory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1473600">Linguists, who study sentences, often talk in terms</span> <span m="1477960">of fundamental patterns that seemed to be in a lot of what</span> <span m="1481430">we say, and a lot of what we say is about objects moving</span> <span m="1485670">along trajectories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489520">So we can talk about a trajectory frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1500680">And a trajectory frame will have elements like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1502650">It has an object moving on a trajectory that ends up at a</span> <span m="1505750">destination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511000">You might start out at a source.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516450">It's probably been arranged by some kind of agent, and the</span> <span m="1521970">agent may assist himself making the motion happen with</span> <span m="1526840">some kind of instrument.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533700">There might be somebody helping out</span> <span m="1535300">over here, a co-agent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1541490">Well, what else can we have?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1542620">A beneficiary, someone is helped out by the action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1555570">Sometimes, the motion is arranged by a conveyance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1565450">So these are a lot of slots, finite slots, and descriptions</span> <span m="1572180">of actions, many of which involve motion on a</span> <span m="1574460">trajectory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1576300">We have a tendency in language to decorate these things in</span> <span m="1579650">one way or another, depending on the language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582540">And so in many languages, the decoration is by way of</span> <span m="1584690">position in the sentence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1586350">In English, it's often by way of a preposition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1589400">It's used to help zero in on a particular role of an object</span> <span m="1599430">in the trajectory scenario.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602550">So if I say, I baked a cake with a friend, there's a with</span> <span m="1609110">preposition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611040">If I baked a cake for a friend, the friend is the</span> <span m="1614750">beneficiary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1616160">If I baked a cake with an oven, that's an instrument.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1621390">The object may be moving to a destination from a source, and</span> <span m="1628480">if I'm going to New York by train, I put a</span> <span m="1631460">by on top of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1634080">If the agent isn't in subject position, I would say</span> <span m="1636290">something like, oh, I see all the work</span> <span m="1638700">was done by a student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641520">So those prepositions have a tendency to help us zoom in on</span> <span m="1643950">the actual role of particular objects in this whole package,</span> <span m="1647130">the whole frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1649630">So this is number three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1654320">There's a variation on this in which there's no actual</span> <span m="1656490">trajectory in which case we'll just call that a role frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1659930">Because if there's no trajectory, we can still have</span> <span m="1661780">things such as an instrument, a co-agent, and a beneficiary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667450">So now, we've got three representations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1670120">You might say, well, what good are they?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1671410">And you can determine what good they are these days</span> <span m="1673680">because it's easier to go over established corpuses, and say,</span> <span m="1677460">what fraction of those, of the sentences, in such a corpus</span> <span m="1681700">involve classification or a transition or a trajectory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1687660">The most well known of these is the so-called Wall Street</span> <span m="1690170">Journal Corpus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690810">It has 50,000 sentences in it, drawn from some period of</span> <span m="1694790">time, all the syntactical language types work with that</span> <span m="1702700">corpus a great deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1704530">And we worked with it a little bit too, to see what fraction</span> <span m="1706570">of the sentences or what the density of trajectories and</span> <span m="1711210">transitions are in those sentences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714170">So I have to say that a little more carefully, because the</span> <span m="1718010">finding is that in 100 sentences you'll find about 25</span> <span m="1728730">transitions or trajectories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1732120">So they're very densely represented.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1734590">They're often very abstract.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1736270">Prices rose, the economy went to someplace, but there are</span> <span m="1745470">still words that denote transition or trajectory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1750660">Of course, once you have all this stuff, that you have then</span> <span m="1754800">have a desire to put it together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1757110">So the next thing we need to talk about is story sequences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762810">So a story sequence can be a single sentence, and I want to</span> <span m="1767200">illustrate that with one of my favorites.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1775050">Here's the sentences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1788220">I think I've chosen a gender neutral name so as not getting</span> <span m="1790915">in any trouble.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1792270">So Pat, but I don't call myself Pat because I decided</span> <span m="1796600">when I was 18 years old that pat is a unit</span> <span m="1798570">of measure for butter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1800470">In any case, with Pat comforted, Mary, do you have</span> <span m="1802550">an image of what happened?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1806100">Probably not a very firm image.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808940">You know that Pat did something, but you don't know</span> <span m="1813520">exactly what.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815790">Nevertheless, when Pat comforted Chris, you can</span> <span m="1819150">construct something that looks like a role frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1826000">Because the role frame for that would have an agent, and</span> <span m="1832930">that would be Pat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1835840">There's an action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1839740">We're going to put a question mark in there because we don't</span> <span m="1841760">have a very firm image of what the action is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1844760">Then again, we're building a wall frame, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1851190">The object is Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1856230">Oh, you know that is the object.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1868160">Is there anything else we can say?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1869710">Oh, yes, we can probably say something more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872820">Something else comes to mind when you see</span> <span m="1875630">Pat comforted Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1877910">There's a sort of result, and the result is</span> <span m="1883120">a transition frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1888515">And the transition frame involves an object, which is</span> <span m="1896370">Chris, and Chris has a mood, which presumably, is improved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1910570">It goes up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1913460">Did you have something, Elliott?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1914855">STUDENT: Could you, I guess, analogize the Pat comforted</span> <span m="1918320">Chris to something like Pat gave comfort to Chris as Chris</span> <span m="1924260">is the destination?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1926240">And couldn't this be [INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1928715">PATRICK WINSTON: Elliott is wandering into a very</span> <span m="1931550">interesting area having to do with, couldn't you think about</span> <span m="1934250">this in another way and think of it as something moving</span> <span m="1937860">along a trajectory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1939230">Comfort is moving, if not from Pat, at least to Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1944600">And that's a very important kind of observation because</span> <span m="1946610">what it would suggest is there can be a utility in thinking</span> <span m="1950220">of things in multiple ways, multiple representations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1953300">Marvin Minsky has a wonderful aphoristic phrase, which is,</span> <span m="1957040">if you can only think about something in one way, you have</span> <span m="1960700">no recourse when you get stuck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1963160">So multiple representations mean you have multiple ways of</span> <span m="1966630">gathering regularity from the world, and collecting it and</span> <span m="1970340">therefore that'll make you smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1972250">So yes, you could do that, and that would be a compliment to</span> <span m="1976080">what I'm doing now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1978020">Let me continue what I'm doing now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979490">So what have I done?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1981780">I've got a role frame and a tradition frame, and the</span> <span m="1985720">transition frame is the target of the result</span> <span m="1989550">slot in the role frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1995110">Now, we can modify this a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000440">And maybe want to say, instead of comforted, terrorized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010840">And how would that change things?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2013490">We don't know exactly what Pat did so the</span> <span m="2017490">action remains unknown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2020180">The agent and the object are the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022670">But the result here is presumably that</span> <span m="2025010">the mood went down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2029590">With just what we've got so far, we can answer a lot of</span> <span m="2031550">questions, by the way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2032460">Once we've got the sentence understood in these terms, we</span> <span m="2035010">can say who did the thing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2037210">What's this all about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2038030">And the answer is Pat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2039490">What did Pat do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040330">Comfort, terrorized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2042130">Who do they do it too?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2043910">Who was the object?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2045310">It's Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2046780">What was the result?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048350">Chris felt better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2049949">Chris felt worse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2052260">So these representations already give us a question and</span> <span m="2054639">answering capability that makes for an understanding of</span> <span m="2062219">the sentence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2064760">But still, we haven't been very specific, so our next</span> <span m="2066920">step takes this same sentence in a more specific direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2071310">So here's a way that goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075300">Kissed Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080469">Now, you begin to get a sense of what's going on, you form a</span> <span m="2084530">mental image, so you could have a hallucination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2093920">And that hallucinations will also be a kind of frame, but,</span> <span m="2097870">in this case, it'll be a trajectory frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2105570">And the object would be, I don't know, Pat's lips.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2116230">And the destination will be Chris' lips.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2126670">I don't know, is that right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2129490">It depends.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2130400">It depends.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131350">Have you all formed a picture of what's going on here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2134800">So it will be different depending on whether Chris is</span> <span m="2140080">Pat's girlfriend or if Chris is Pat's daughter or if Chris</span> <span m="2147970">is a frog and Pat is a prince -ess, I guess, the way the</span> <span m="2153830">story usually goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2158080">So somehow we have, in our heads, all kinds of libraries</span> <span m="2161080">that help us to form mental pictures of things when we see</span> <span m="2163490">things like kissed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2166470">So one final one just to show the variety.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2170870">We could say that Pat stabbed Chris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180670">What changes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2183410">Let's see, in the case of kissed, the mood is going up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2188550">In the case of stabbed, the mood is going down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2191760">You can also probably say that the health is going down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2196710">And the destination is Chris' body.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201310">And the object that's moving is Pat's knife.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207660">We get the same pattern with both of those sentences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2211460">So both of them involve a sequence that starts off with</span> <span m="2215060">the action, moves to a transition and a trajectory</span> <span m="2218080">and those are all arranged in a line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220140">And that line is something that gives us a lot of power</span> <span m="2226790">over the situation relative to a semantic net.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230460">So I'm going to decorate that one more time, and say that</span> <span m="2234360">another element we get out of our</span> <span m="2236580">internal language is sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239160">An element we need in order to have anything that looks like</span> <span m="2244110">an account of an inner language is sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2247510">Because if you think about things being arrayed in a vast</span> <span m="2250370">spreading network, it's hard to deal with them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2252520">But if you thing about things being arrayed along a line, in</span> <span m="2256320">a sequence of actions or events, like so, then that</span> <span m="2262490">imposes enough constraint to get a handle on</span> <span m="2265530">what's going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2267330">So what we're going to call this is the representation,</span> <span m="2272050">and I guess I'm up to one, two, three, four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2276100">This is a representation of story sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2286660">so even though that's a kind of micro-story, it's still an</span> <span m="2289420">example of a story sequence because we get the power out</span> <span m="2293510">of it by arranging everything in a line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297406">You have a sense, I think, especially if you play a</span> <span m="2300400">musical instrument, on how dependent we are on sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2304160">So if you play a musical instrument, you probably know</span> <span m="2306580">how difficult it is to start replaying a piece of music</span> <span m="2311270">from the middle of a measure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2313380">You have to go back to at least the beginning of the</span> <span m="2315440">measure, and probably to the beginning of the phrase, if</span> <span m="2317545">not the beginning of the piece.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2319330">So our memory seems to be, at least in music, very rooted in</span> <span m="2323880">the idea of sequences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2326250">And that's often true of storytelling too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2328475">We have to go back to the beginning of at least a scene,</span> <span m="2332100">because somehow these things are arranged in sequences that</span> <span m="2336260">form, somehow, usefulness out of their sequentialness.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2343070">So there's one more thing we can talk about and that is the</span> <span m="2345280">idea of not just the idea of how these sequences are</span> <span m="2351920">constructed and what they're constructed out of, but we can</span> <span m="2354840">also talk a little bit in terms of libraries of stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2367640">And when we talk about libraries of stories, we can</span> <span m="2369840">think about kind of the sort of standard stories that we</span> <span m="2373350">have and how they're arranged, and how we can know a lot</span> <span m="2376290">about something by what it's super class is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2379840">So it's a variation on the theme of learning stuff from</span> <span m="2383770">the super classes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2385520">So here's an event frame.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390780">And then, in addition to event frames,</span> <span m="2394990">there's disaster frames.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2399700">And then there are party frames.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404320">And parties and disasters are both events.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2411010">And when we talk about disasters, we know, in turn,</span> <span m="2413520">they break up in a variety of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415630">We have earthquake disasters, and maybe we have hurricanes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2427890">And in the party world we have, I don't know, birthday</span> <span m="2430440">parties, and we have weddings.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2441310">And each of these types of frames invites us to fill in</span> <span m="2444920">particular slots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2446050">So if we're reading a newspaper story about a</span> <span m="2447910">wedding, we know that we're going to be learning the same</span> <span m="2451730">sorts of things we will learn about any party except there</span> <span m="2454870">is the additional information that we expect that says</span> <span m="2458790">something about the bride and the groom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470220">If we have a raw event and we don't know anything more about</span> <span m="2473150">it than that, there's a time and place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2480480">If it's a disaster frame, it gets a grizzly over here, but</span> <span m="2483800">if there's a disaster frame, we might have the fatalities,</span> <span m="2491080">and how much it cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494800">If it's an earthquake frame, we need to know the magnitude</span> <span m="2500800">of the quake, and the name of the fault.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2506540">If it's a hurricane, we have the category and the name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2516140">So each of these things up there can be viewed, not just</span> <span m="2521040">an example of something, but as a new frame all by itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2525690">As we mature, we have these first four things as building</span> <span m="2530500">blocks, and then, we educate ourselves, and we get all</span> <span m="2534470">those kinds of frames that help us to</span> <span m="2536370">understand the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539290">But how to fill those in from a newspaper story can be</span> <span m="2544150">sometimes, quite a challenge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545780">Actually the worst thing to understand is children's</span> <span m="2549910">stories because, and this was determined experimentally when</span> <span m="2556820">people tried to understand children's stories, because it</span> <span m="2559350">turns out that children's stories are not simpler than</span> <span m="2565450">the stories we write for adults.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2566540">In many cases, they're harder.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2570550">If you read about Shakespearean plots, it's all</span> <span m="2572350">about intrigue, murder, jealousy, greed, but when</span> <span m="2576360">you're trying to write a children's story it can be</span> <span m="2578540">about anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2581300">And worse yet, the children's story often raises problems</span> <span m="2588200">that you don't see in newspaper stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2589830">Let me illustrate that for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2599310">You want to read that story?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605080">You have no trouble figuring it out, of course, but think</span> <span m="2607670">about a poor machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2610090">It's struggling to understand anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2612570">What's going to be the problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2616010">It's going to have trouble figuring out those pronoun</span> <span m="2617700">antecedents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2619480">Look at them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2619990">They're complicated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2623620">[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span m="2625750">PATRICK WINSTON: Shut [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2631755">Oh, that's the way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2636960">[INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2640640">Here are the pronouns.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2643000">One of them wanted to buy a kite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2645940">He has one, he said.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647240">He will make you take it back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2650230">So that's pretty hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651030">Actually, the principal here that I'm driving at is, when</span> <span m="2654790">you have a new story or any story, if you have an old</span> <span m="2657750">story but you want to read it-- when you want to</span> <span m="2659080">understand it quickly, the instantiation of it quickly,</span> <span m="2663350">you need to be sure that, if you're the storyteller, you</span> <span m="2666980">don't add to the burden of the understanding any syntactic</span> <span m="2669650">difficulty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670840">So that's an example of telling a story with</span> <span m="2672790">additional syntactic difficulty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675470">No newspaper journalist would ever write</span> <span m="2679360">the story like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2681000">Here's how they would write it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2687760">They would even give you a clue that there's certain</span> <span m="2690130">information you're never going to get, like</span> <span m="2692720">who told the story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2694600">It's that reliable sources business.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2698070">So this brings us to the final bit that I want to deal with</span> <span m="2702550">today, and what I'm going to do is, if you came into this</span> <span m="2705150">class today as a 97 pound writing weakling, you're about</span> <span m="2709660">to emerge as a 250 pound mountain of a writer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2714730">Because I want to tell you a few tricks that will make you</span> <span m="2716630">usually better as a writer, especially if</span> <span m="2720540">you're Russian or German.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2725200">And here's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2727120">Rule one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2744920">Because they place additional syntactic burden on the</span> <span m="2747640">understanding of the story by the reader.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2750520">So if you're telling somebody about some difficult new</span> <span m="2753450">technical idea, the last thing you want them to do is to</span> <span m="2756740">burden their syntactic processor with figuring out</span> <span m="2758990">pronoun antecedents.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761040">So don't use pronouns in you're writing, technical</span> <span m="2763240">writing, at least, will be much clearer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765800">By the way, why does this especially apply to Germans</span> <span m="2768490">and Russians?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2770230">Is it because--</span> <span m="2771980">is this an ethnic origin slur or is this a</span> <span m="2774900">fact about their language?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2776310">It's a fact about their language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2777370">Where is the fact?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2780380">Why can they get away with pronoun usages that we cannot</span> <span m="2783570">get away with in English?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2785910">Yes, Andrew?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2786470">STUDENT: Gender and also--</span> <span m="2789802">PATRICK WINSTON: Gender, because if you have all of</span> <span m="2795240">your nouns decorated with gender, that reduces by three,</span> <span m="2802530">the potential for ambiguity in the pronoun antecedent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2805960">So you'll frequently find that German and Russian writers</span> <span m="2808540">will have pronouns all over the place that are perfectly</span> <span m="2810970">clear to them because of gender.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2812930">They are interpretable by English speakers when</span> <span m="2815170">translated because we don't have the gender to</span> <span m="2816890">help us zero in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2819720">So these things all have to do with minimizing extra,</span> <span m="2823890">superfluous, gratuitous, unnecessary</span> <span m="2826170">burden on the reader.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2827330">Number two is don't use former or latter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2836950">You see those words used frequently in technical</span> <span m="2839660">writing, and guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2841310">No human being ever encounters those words without having to</span> <span m="2844400">stop and go back to figure out what they refer to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2848370">So that's another example of not placing any unnecessary</span> <span m="2850970">syntactic burden on the reader.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2853370">And finally, don't call a shovel a spade.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2865000">There's a habit, probably instilled by well-meaning but</span> <span m="2867680">misadvised high school teachers, that you shouldn't</span> <span m="2869500">repeat words, and so people go to great lengths to use some</span> <span m="2873530">different word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2874830">The problem is that the reader doesn't know if the shift in</span> <span m="2877640">the word is deliberate and attached to some subtle</span> <span m="2881640">meaning shift, or if it's just adhering to some high school</span> <span m="2885320">teacher's admonition against using the same word again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2888720">So you don't want to say, oh, the right way to dig this</span> <span m="2892540">particular hole is with a spade and then switch to a</span> <span m="2895230">shovel because the reader can't tell if it's deliberate,</span> <span m="2898350">accidental, or a consequence of just the desire not to use</span> <span m="2901840">the same word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2903450">So this is how you, with some very simple mechanisms</span> <span m="2908510">grounded in AI, you can actually make yourself into a</span> <span m="2910660">better writer by avoiding those kinds of things that put</span> <span m="2913280">an unnecessary syntactic burden on the people who are</span> <span m="2915700">reading your stuff.</span> </p>

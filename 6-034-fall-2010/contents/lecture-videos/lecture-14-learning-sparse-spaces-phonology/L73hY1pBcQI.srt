1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,220
PATRICK WINSTON: So today we're
gonna talk about a few

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,980
miracles of learning in the
context of the theme that

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,930
we're developing here
in the class.

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,900
We started off with
a discussion

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,260
of some basic methods.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,610
We talked about nearest
neighbors.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,250
And we talked about
identification trees.

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,560
And those are kind of basic
things that have been around

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,740
for a long time.

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,690
Still useful.

11
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,250
Still the right things to do
when you're faced with a

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,840
learning problem and you're not
sure what method to try.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,870
Then we went on to talk about
some naive biological mimicry.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,700
We talked about neural nets.

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,650
And we talked about genetic
algorithms.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,270
And you look at those things and
you think and reflect back

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,440
on what we talked about.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,010
And you have to say
to yourself, are

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,039
these nugatory ideas?

20
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,760
Perhaps pistareens?

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,300
Or are they supererogatory
ideas that deserve to be

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,550
center stage?

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,770
Does anybody know what
those words mean?

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,780
A pistareen?

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, a pistareen is
a Spanish coin.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,900
It was so small.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,130
It was of little worth.

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:43,460
These ideas like neural nets,
genetic algorithms, I classify

29
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,820
them as pistareens because
getting them to do something

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,610
is rather like getting a dog
to walk on its hind legs.

31
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,700
You can make it happen, but they
never do it very well.

32
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,000
And you have to think it took a
lot of trickery and training

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,250
to make it happen.

34
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:08,150
So not too personally
high on those ideas.

35
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,620
But we teach them to you anyway
because, of course, we

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,250
only editorialize part of time
and part of time we like to

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,310
cover what's in the field.

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,460
Today we're starting a couple
of discussions of mechanisms

39
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,940
or ideas or things
to know about

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,690
that are quite different.

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,690
Because now we're going to focus
on the problem rather

42
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,930
than on the mechanism.

43
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,120
And then a later on we're
going to talk about deep

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,005
theory, FIOS, for
its own sake.

45
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,560
But this week I want
to talk about

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,090
mechanisms that were devised.

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,760
I want to talk about research
that was done.

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,020
Let me not say mechanisms.

49
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,530
Let me say research that was
done to attempt an account of

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,040
some of the things that
we humans do well.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,460
Sometimes without even knowing
that we do it.

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,110
Now Krishna here tells me his
first language was Telugu.

53
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,790
Telugu.

54
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,270
I once had another student
whose first

55
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,160
language was Telugu.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,100
I said to him, that must
be one of those

57
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,480
obscure Indian languages.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,470
And he said, yes.

59
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,570
It's spoken by 56
million people.

60
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,756
French is spoken by 52.

61
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,202
[LAUGHTER]

62
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,650
PATRICK WINSTON: He's going to
be our experimental subject.

63
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,040
Krishna, if I pluralize words--
you know what it means

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,120
to pluralize a word.

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,595
So if I say for example, horse,
then if I ask you for

66
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,220
the plural you'll say horses.

67
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,500
So if I say dog, what's
the plural?

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,380
STUDENT: Then dogs.

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,222
Or in my language?

70
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:45,730
PATRICK WINSTON: No, no, no.

71
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,680
In English.

72
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
STUDENT: Oh, dogs.

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,977
PATRICK WINSTON: Well,
what about cat?

74
00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:49,771
STUDENT: Cats.

75
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,950
PATRICK WINSTON: And
he got it right.

76
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,250
Isn't that a miracle?

77
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,570
When did you start
speaking English?

78
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,560
STUDENT: Second grade.

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,190
PATRICK WINSTON: Second grade.

80
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,600
But he still got it right.

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,740
But he never learned that he's
actually pluralizing those

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,790
words differently.

83
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,320
But he is.

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,090
So when you pluralize
dog, what's the

85
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,600
sound that comes after?

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,770
It's a z sound.

87
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,870
Zzzzzz.

88
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,710
Dogzzz.

89
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,902
If you stick your fingers up
here you can probably feel

90
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,428
your vocal cords vibrating.

91
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,040
If you stick a piece of paper in
front of your mouth you'll

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,000
see it vibrate.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,260
But when you say cats,
the pluralizing sound

94
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,710
is sss, like that.

95
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,920
No vocalizing.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,113
No vibration of the
vocal cords.

97
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,510
And old Krishna here learned
that rule, as did all of you

98
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,330
other non-native speakers of
English, effortlessly and

99
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,190
without noticing it.

100
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,335
You learned it.

101
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,650
Buy you always get it right.

102
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,170
How can that possibly be?

103
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,250
Well, be the end of hour you'll
know how that might be.

104
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,060
And you'll experience a case
study in how questions of that

105
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,909
sort can be approached
with a sort of

106
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,159
engineering point of view.

107
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,680
You can say, what if God
were an engineer?

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,730
Or alternatively, what if I were
God and I am an engineer?

109
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,810
Think about how it might
happen that way.

110
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,150
So we want to understand how it
might be that the machine

111
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,700
could learn rules like that.

112
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,690
Phonological rules.

113
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,200
Not just that one, but all the
phonological rules you'd

114
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,540
acquire in a course
on phonology.

115
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,990
That part of speaking that deals
with those syllabic and

116
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,740
sub-syllabic sounds.

117
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,970
The phones of the language.

118
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,890
So when Yip and Sussman
undertook to solve this

119
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,950
engineering problem, both being
dedicated engineers, the

120
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,560
first thing they did was
learn the science.

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
So they went to sit at the
foot of Morris Halle, who

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,510
would develop-- was largely
responsible for the

123
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,280
development theories of

124
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,940
so-called distinctive features.

125
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,200
And here's how all that works.

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,030
You start off with a person who
wants to say something.

127
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,650
And out that person's mouth
comes some sort of acoustic

128
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,670
pressure wave.

129
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,780
And if I say, hello, George.

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,560
And you say hello, George.

131
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
Everybody will understand that
we said the same thing.

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,540
But that acoustic waveform won't
look anything alike.

133
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,790
It'll be very different
for all of us.

134
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,310
So it's a miracle that words
can be understood.

135
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,240
In any case, it goes
into an ear.

136
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
And it's processed.

137
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,325
And out comes a sequence
of distinctive feature.

138
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,690
Vectors.

139
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,170
A distinctive feature is a
binary variable like is the

140
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,880
phone voices or not.

141
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,830
That is to say, are your
vocal cords vibrating

142
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,840
when you say it?

143
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,970
If so, then that's
plus voiced.

144
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,360
If not, it's minus voiced.

145
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,440
So according to the original
distinctive feature theory and

146
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,650
consistent with most of the
theories that have been

147
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,740
derived since the original one,
there are on the order of

148
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,300
14 of these distinctive features
that determine which

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,090
phone you're saying.

150
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,260
So if you say ah, that's
one combination of

151
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,715
these binary features.

152
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:40,659
If you say tuh, that's another
combination of

153
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,659
these binary features.

154
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:45,040
14 of them.

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,909
So how many sounds does that
mean, in principle, there

156
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,770
could be in a language?

157
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,165
SEBASTIAN: 2 to the 14th.

158
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:58,300
PATRICK WINSTON: And what's
2 the 14th, Sebastian?

159
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,920
Well, it ought to be about
16,000, don't you think?

160
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,350
2 to the 10th is 1,000.

161
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,310
2 the fourth is 16.

162
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,480
So there are about 16,000
possible combination.

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,100
But no language on Earth has
more than 100 phones.

164
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,910
That's strange, isn't it?

165
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,670
Because some of those choices
are probably excluded on

166
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,390
physical ground.

167
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,730
But most of them are not.

168
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,870
So we could have a lot more
phones in our language than we

169
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,780
actually do.

170
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,630
English is about 40.

171
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,070
So the sequence of distinctive
features could be viewed as

172
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:41,090
then producing meaning after,
perhaps, a long series of

173
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,620
operations.

174
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,730
But in the end, those operations
feedback in here

175
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,560
because many of the distinctive
features are

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
actually hallucinated.

177
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
We think we heard them,
but they're not there.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
Or they're not even in the
acoustic waveform.

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,345
They're there for the
convenience of the phonologist

180
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:01,210
who make rules out of them.

181
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:10,670
It's remarkable how much of this
feedback there is, and

182
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,570
even injection from
other modalities.

183
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,730
Many of you may have heard
about the McGurk Effect.

184
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,310
Here's who the McGurk
Effect works.

185
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,270
Look at me while I say ga,
ga, ga, ga, ga, ga.

186
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,580
OK.

187
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,120
I said, g-a.

188
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,050
Now how about ba, ba, ba, ba.

189
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:30,460
OK.

190
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,130
I said ba like a sheep.

191
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,730
But if I take the sound I make
when I say ba and play it

192
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,730
while you're taking video of
me saying ga, what do you

193
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,840
think you hear?

194
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't hear ba.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,030
Some people report that they
hear a d-a sound like da.

196
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,200
When I look at it, I can't
make any sense out of it.

197
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,270
It looks like there's a
disconnection between the

198
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,470
speech and the video.

199
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,916
But it does not sound like ba.

200
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,740
But if I shut my eyes and say
ba, ba, it's absolutely clear

201
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,350
that it's b-a.

202
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,280
So what you see has a large
influence on what you hear.

203
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
It's also interesting--

204
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,690
although a side issue-- it's
also interesting to note that

205
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,350
it's very difficult pronounced
things correctly if you don't

206
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,230
see the speaker.

207
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,360
So many people wonder when they
learn foreign languages

208
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,600
why they can't speak
like a native.

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,020
And the answer is, they're
not watching the

210
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,160
mouth of the speaker.

211
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,665
I was talking to a German friend
once and said, you

212
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:39,796
know, I just can't say the
damned umlaut right.

213
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:42,470
And he said, oh, the trouble
with you Americans is you

214
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,080
don't realize that American
cows say moo but

215
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,530
German cows say muu.

216
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:48,910
[LAUGHTER]

217
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,130
PATRICK WINSTON: And, of
course, I got instantly

218
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,410
because I could see that the
umlaut sounds are produced

219
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,290
with protruding lips, which we
don't have any sounds an

220
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,766
English that require that.

221
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:03,180
Ah, but back to what we know
from the phonologists about

222
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,450
all this stuff.

223
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,740
If you talk to Morris
Halle, he will tell

224
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,490
you that over here--

225
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,100
I like to think of it
as a marionette.

226
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,860
There are five pieces
of meat down here.

227
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,330
And the combination of
distinctive features that

228
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,250
you're trying to utter are
like the control of a

229
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,320
marionette on those five
pieces of meat.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,020
So if you want to say an a
sound, the marionette control

231
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,310
goes into a position that
produces that combination.

232
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:36,970
So let's see.

233
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,110
What does that distinctive
feature sequence look like for

234
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,920
typical word?

235
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,020
Well, here's a word.

236
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,270
A-e-p-l.

237
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,340
Apples.

238
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,580
And we can talk about what
distinctive features are

239
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,380
arrayed in that particular
combination of phones.

240
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,040
So one of the features
that they like to

241
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,580
talk about is syllabic.

242
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,830
Syllabic.

243
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,240
That roughly means, can that
sound form the sort of core of

244
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,710
a syllable?

245
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,930
And the answer is a can,
buy these can't.

246
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,060
So it's plus, minus,
minus, minus.

247
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,040
Down here a little ways you'll
run into the voiced feature.

248
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,735
And for the voiced feature,
well, we can do

249
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,160
the experiment ourselves.

250
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,500
Ahh.

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,540
Sounds like it's voices to me.

252
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,340
Pa.

253
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,790
No.

254
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,970
That's not voiced.

255
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,390
Oo.

256
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,080
Yep.

257
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,540
Zzz.

258
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,180
We already said that
was voiced.

259
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,940
So that's the combination you
see when you utter apples for

260
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,670
the voiced feature.

261
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,540
Then another one is the
continuent one.

262
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,290
That roughly says is your
vocal apparatus open?

263
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,370
Is there no obstruction?

264
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,750
And so ahh plus pa
is constricted.

265
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,100
Oo, open.

266
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,960
Zzz, open.

267
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
So that one happens to run right
along with voiced in

268
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,040
that particular word.

269
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh, and there are
14 altogether.

270
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,510
But let me just write
down one more.

271
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,760
The strident one.

272
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,000
That says, do you use your
tongue to form a

273
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
little jet of air?

274
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,735
So you don't on aa, pa, oo.

275
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,220
Buy you do on z.

276
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,600
So that gets a plus.

277
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,530
So that's a glimpse through a
soda straw of what it would

278
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,980
like to represent the word
apples as a set of distinctive

279
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,350
features all arranged
in a sequence.

280
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,760
So it's a matrix of features.

281
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,750
Going down in the columns we
have our distinctive features.

282
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,250
And going across we have time.

283
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,230
So as the first thing Sussman
and Yip did in their effort to

284
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,610
understand how phonological
rules could be learned is to

285
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,880
design a machine that would
interpret words and sounds and

286
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,260
things that you see so
as to produce the

287
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,470
sounds of the language.

288
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,820
So they imagined the following
kind of machine.

289
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,320
The machine has some kind of
mystery apparatus over here

290
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,290
that looks out into the world
and sees what's there.

291
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,570
So I'm looking out in the world
and I see two apples.

292
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:39,090
So what this machine might do
then is, at some point, decide

293
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,490
that there are two
apples out there.

294
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,340
Then, thinking in terms of
these guys as computer

295
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,460
engineers, they think in terms
of a set of registers that

296
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:58,700
hold values for concepts like
noun and verb and plural.

297
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,130
And we've not done anything
with the machine yet.

298
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,520
We've provided no input.

299
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,260
So those registers
are all empty.

300
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,135
Then, up in here, we have
a set of words.

301
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,470
And they're all kinds
of words.

302
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,720
Apple is one of them.

303
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,540
And those words up there know
about how the concept is

304
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,990
rendered as a sequence of a
phones, that is to say a

305
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:41,430
sequence of distinct features.

306
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,450
Then, over here, most
importantly, they have a set

307
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,700
of constraints.

308
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,050
So we'll talk about a particular
constrain, the

309
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,300
plural constraint.

310
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,380
Plural constraint number one.

311
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,040
And it's going to reach around
and connect itself to some

312
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,570
other parts of the machine.

313
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:17,470
Finally, there's a buffer
of phones to be uttered.

314
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,650
And they're going to flow out
this way to the speaker's

315
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:26,770
mouth and get translated into
a acoustic wave form.

316
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,680
So those are the elements
of the machine.

317
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,380
Now how are the elements
connected together?

318
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:47,460
Well, the words are connected,
of course, into the buffer

319
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,550
that is used to generate
the sound over

320
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,360
here on the far left.

321
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,150
The plural register is
connected to what

322
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,080
you see in the world.

323
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,580
What you see in the world is
connected not only to plural

324
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,530
register, but to all of the
objects in the word

325
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,780
repertoire.

326
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,950
This plural constraint here
deserves extra attention

327
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:21,868
because it's going to be
desirous of actuating itself

328
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,839
in the event but the
thing observed in

329
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,630
the world is plural.

330
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,520
There are lots of them.

331
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,285
So it's going to be connected
then to the plural port.

332
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:40,050
There's going to be a z sound
port down here connecting to

333
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,650
that file element
in the buffer.

334
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,430
And finally, over here is going
to be a plussed voiced

335
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,370
port, which is going to be
connected to the second

336
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,270
phoneme in the sequence.

337
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,130
That's how the machine is
going to be arranged.

338
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,630
An of course, this is just
one of many constraints.

339
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:12,410
But it's a constraint that has
a very peculiar property.

340
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,410
Information can flow through
it in multiple ways.

341
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,430
So we think of most programs
as having an

342
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,430
input and an output.

343
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,630
But I try to be careful
to draw circles

344
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,560
here instead of arrows.

345
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,170
Because these are ports and
information can flow in any

346
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,890
direction along them.

347
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,240
What I want to do now is to
show you how this machine

348
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,540
would react if I suddenly
present it with a pair of

349
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,570
apples like so.

350
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,740
So the assumption is that the
vision apparatus comes in and

351
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:51,140
produces the notion, the
concept, of two apples.

352
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,690
So once that has happened--

353
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,530
that's operation number one--

354
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,850
then information flows from that
meaning register up here

355
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,810
to the apple word.

356
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,700
So that's part of stage
number two.

357
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,240
Another part of stage number two
is information flows along

358
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,200
this wire and marks that
as plus plural.

359
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,290
So operation number one is the
activity of the vision system.

360
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,770
Activity number two is the flow
of information from that

361
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,010
vision system into the
word lexicon and

362
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,090
into this plural register.

363
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,900
So far so good.

364
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,560
Here's activity number three.

365
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,850
This word is also connected
to the registers.

366
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:53,900
And information flows along
those wires so as to indicate

367
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,860
that it's a noun
but not a verb.

368
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,640
That's part of part
number three.

369
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,050
At the same time, part number
three, information flows down

370
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:11,000
this wire and writes a-p-l
into those are

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,322
elements of the buffer.

372
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,490
Now this constraint up here,
this box, says, well, I can

373
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,480
now see some stuff in
that buffer that

374
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,430
wasn't there before.

375
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,410
So it says, do I see enough
stuff on my ports to get

376
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,300
excited about expressing
values on other ports?

377
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,730
Well, let's see.

378
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,780
What has it got?

379
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,890
It's got the elements
in this buffer.

380
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:42,270
Also up here in step three
flow the plural thing.

381
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,400
So it know that the
word is plural.

382
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,670
So it says, is this voiced?

383
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,130
P is pa.

384
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,920
That's not voiced.

385
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,180
Is this a z sound.

386
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,410
No, that's not as z sound.

387
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,930
So it sees what it likes on only
one of its three ports.

388
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,750
So it says, I'm not going
to do anything.

389
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

390
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,370
I'm not in this particular
combat.

391
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,440
So far so good.

392
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,460
What happens next?

393
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,100
What happens next is that
some time passes.

394
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,780
And the elements of the buffer
flow to the left toward the

395
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,820
speaker's mouth.

396
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,720
So we get an a, p, l.

397
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,700
Same as we had before,
but shifted over.

398
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,950
Now what happens?

399
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,870
Now what happens is that
the l is now in

400
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,680
the penultimate position.

401
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,100
So information flows up here.

402
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,860
Item number four-- oh, I guess
that's item number five.

403
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,290
Item number four is the leftward
flow of the word.

404
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,360
So in phase number five, the
p is witnessed by this

405
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,990
constraint.

406
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,210
p is--

407
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,990
sorry, l is witnessed
by this constraint.

408
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,950
We moved it over one.

409
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,850
L is lll.

410
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,570
L is voiced.

411
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,940
So we have some flow
up here like that.

412
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,470
That's number five.

413
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,640
Now we have voiced and
we have plural.

414
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,940
And we have nothing here.

415
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,340
So there's a great desire of
this buffer to have something

416
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,500
written into it.

417
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,370
So now there's a flow
down in there, of z,

418
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,170
as item number six.

419
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,730
So that's how the machine would
work in expressing the

420
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,580
idea that there are apples
in the field of view.

421
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:36,610
Mmm.

422
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,720
Real apples.

423
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,970
Not plastic imitations.

424
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,140
So that's how the
machine works.

425
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,505
But all those connections
are reversible.

426
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,545
So if I hear apples then I get
the machine running backwards

427
00:22:56,545 --> 00:23:00,025
and my visual apparatus
can imagine that there

428
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,692
are apples out there.

429
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,030
That's how it works.

430
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,090
That's just by way of background
the machine that

431
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,490
they could see it for using the
phonological rules once

432
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,880
they're learned.

433
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,400
All the phonological rules
are expressed in these

434
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,710
constraints.

435
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,270
But since these constraints are
such that information can

436
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,990
flow in any direction, they
deserve to be called

437
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,240
propagators.

438
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,760
And in the good old days when
everyone took 6.001, they

439
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,370
learned about propagators as
a kind of architecture for

440
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,380
building complex systems.

441
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,060
But in any event, there's
the Sussman-Yip machine.

442
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,600
And now comes the
big question.

443
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,010
How do you learn rule
rules like that?

444
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,120
Well, what we need is we need
some positive examples and

445
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,370
some negative examples.

446
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,210
And for the simple classroom
example I've chosen the same

447
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,780
challenge that I presented
to Krishna.

448
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,730
We're gonna have
cats and dogs.

449
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,340
So we're gonna look at the
distinctive features that are

450
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,620
associated with those words.

451
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,020
Syllabic.

452
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,270
Voiced.

453
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,300
Continuent.

454
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,760
And strident.

455
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,130
Just four of the 14 features
that are associated with each

456
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,940
of the sounds on those words.

457
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,370
Could you close the
laptop, please?

458
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,375
Just for the distinctive
features that are arrayed in

459
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:51,160
those words by way
of illustration.

460
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,410
So here we have k-a-t-z.

461
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,700
Phonetically spelled.

462
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,810
And if we work that
out, let's see.

463
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,460
What is syllabic?

464
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,900
That's not.

465
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,450
That is.

466
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,060
That is.

467
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,090
That's not.

468
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,610
Voiced?

469
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,170
Ka.

470
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,204
Nope.

471
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:16,648
Ah.

472
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,980
Yep.

473
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,570
T. Nope.

474
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,540
Z. Yes.

475
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,660
That can't be right.

476
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,070
Cats.

477
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,610
I misspelled it.

478
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,225
Because cats.

479
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,310
Sss.

480
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,590
His a hissing sound but
there's no voicing.

481
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,910
So that's not as z sound.

482
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,780
That's an s sound.

483
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,960
So that's not plus voiced.

484
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,860
It's minused voiced.

485
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,980
Continuent.

486
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,670
Let's see.

487
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,180
Is my mouth open when I say k?

488
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,120
No.

489
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,420
Ah?

490
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,790
Yes.

491
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,280
T?

492
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,660
No.

493
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,110
S?

494
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,860
Yes.

495
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,870
And strident.

496
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,120
Minus, minus, minus, plus.

497
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,650
It's only with the s sound that
I have that kind of jet

498
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,270
forming with my tongue.

499
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,520
Now we can look at dogs.

500
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,450
And now we have the z sound
as the pluralization.

501
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,230
We know that because when
we say it, dogzz.

502
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,700
Yep.

503
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,450
There it comes out as a--

504
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,770
we're only gonna look at the
last two columns because

505
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,640
they're the only ones that are
going to matter to us.

506
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,960
So that's plus.

507
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,906
And that's minus.

508
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,156
Gu, gu, gu, gu.

509
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,240
That's plussed.

510
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,220
And that's plussed.

511
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,230
They're both voiced.

512
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,730
Is that right?

513
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,800
Dogu?

514
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,700
Gu.

515
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,170
Gu.

516
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,430
Is g sound voiced?

517
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,156
Yeah, I didn't think so.

518
00:26:53,156 --> 00:26:54,630
G sound is voiced?

519
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,223
Look-- oh.

520
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:08,072
Oh, it is voiced buy it's
not a continuent.

521
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:10,400
Just like that.

522
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,270
Yeah.

523
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,280
Cat, dogu zz.

524
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,645
Yeah.

525
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:13,760
It is voiced.

526
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,276
And it has to be for my
example to work out.

527
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:20,390
And that's minus, minus,
minus, plus.

528
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,870
So what we're interested in is,
how come one word gets an

529
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,020
s sound and how come the other
words gets a z sound?

530
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,290
Well, it's a pretty sparse
space out there.

531
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,670
We've already decided that
there are 14,000 possible

532
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,640
phonemes and there are only
40 in the language.

533
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,310
So that's one thing
we can consider.

534
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,800
The other thing that we can
think is that, well, maybe

535
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,100
this is a logical problem.

536
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,556
Like the kind of problem
you'd face if you

537
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,470
were designing a computer.

538
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,870
And so Sussman and Yip got
stuck for three months

539
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,250
thinking about the
problem that way.

540
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,050
Couldn't make any progress
whatsoever.

541
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,920
And that happens a lot when
you're doing a search.

542
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,940
You think you've got a way
of approaching it.

543
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,210
Try to make it work.

544
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,300
You stay up all night.

545
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,550
Stay up all night again.

546
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,310
Still can't make it work.

547
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,222
Eventually, you abandon ship
and try something else.

548
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:14,820
So then they began to say,
well, let's see.

549
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,880
All we care about is the stuff
before the two ending sounds.

550
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,580
We care about that part
of the matrix.

551
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,250
And we care about that
part of the matrix.

552
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,730
And we can ask, in what ways
are those things different?

553
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,150
And they're different
all over the place.

554
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,090
That's why they're
different words.

555
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,730
We can ask the question a
little bit differently.

556
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,380
And we can say, what can
we not care about?

557
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,860
And still retain enough of an
understanding of how the words

558
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,990
are different so as to put the
proper plural ending on them.

559
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,075
And they worried about
that for a long time.

560
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:50,250
Couldn't find a solution.

561
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,840
The search space was too big.

562
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,160
And then they said, maybe what
we ought to do is we ought to

563
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,550
think about generalizing this
guy here so that we

564
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,640
don't care about it.

565
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,080
So now we don't care
about that guy.

566
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,220
And then he went down through
here saying, well, let's see

567
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,740
when we have to stop
generalizing.

568
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,790
Because we've screwed everything
up and we can no

569
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,200
longer keep the z sound
words separated

570
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,470
from the s sound words.

571
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,240
So that eventually distilled
itself down to

572
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,490
the following algorithm.

573
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:37,010
First thing they did was
to collect positive

574
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,485
and negative examples.

575
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,870
And there's a positive example
and a negative example.

576
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,250
That's not enough
to do it right.

577
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,960
But that's enough to illustrate
the idea.

578
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,060
So the next thing they did was
something that's extremely

579
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,930
common in learning anything.

580
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,950
And that is to pick a positive
example to start from.

581
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,900
It's actually not a bad idea in
learning anything to start

582
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,650
with a positive example.

583
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,480
So they picked a positive
example and they

584
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,730
called that a seed.

585
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,070
So in our particular case, cats
is going to be our seed.

586
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,700
And the question we're going to
ask is, what are the words

587
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,530
that get pluralized like cat?

588
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,350
So we've got a positive
and negative example.

589
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,890
We've picked a seed.

590
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,385
And now, the next step
is to generalize.

591
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,360
And what I mean by generalize is
you pick some places in the

592
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,160
phoneme matrix that you
just don't care about.

593
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,710
So you may pick a positive
example.

594
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,100
And you don't care about it.

595
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,960
So you change it to an asterisk
or, as demonstrated

596
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,600
in the program I'm about
show you, a ball.

597
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,820
Or you pick one that's
negative and you

598
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,240
turn it to a ball.

599
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,630
Bo.

600
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,210
So cats, this seed,
becomes a pattern.

601
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,470
And in order to pluralize the
word this way, you have to

602
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,100
match all the stuff in here.

603
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,390
But now what we're going to do
is we're going to gradually

604
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:28,860
turn some of those elements into
don't care symbols until

605
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:32,910
we get to a point where we've
not cared about so much stuff

606
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,470
that we think that we
pluralize that one

607
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,200
with an s sound too.

608
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:46,100
So we keep generalizing until
we cover, that is to say we

609
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,561
admit or match, a negative
example.

610
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:53,070
So that's how it works.

611
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,980
So we generalize like crazy.

612
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,830
And as soon as we cover a
negative example, we quit.

613
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:08,410
Otherwise, we just go back up
here and generalize some more.

614
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,670
And now we've got to pick a
search technique to decide

615
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,790
which of these guys to actually
generalize when.

616
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,940
We could pick one at random.

617
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,870
And they tried that.

618
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,641
It didn't work.

619
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,440
So what they decided is that the
thing that influences the

620
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,740
pluralization most is the
adjacent phoneme.

621
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,240
And if that isn't the thing that
solves the problem, it'll

622
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
be the one next to that.

623
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,837
So in other words, the closer
you are, the more likely you

624
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:37,800
are to determine the outcome.

625
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,770
So these guys over here are
least likely to matter.

626
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,530
And those are the ones that
are generalized first.

627
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,390
So if we do that,
what happens?

628
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,050
Looks like we're going to come
in here and see that there's a

629
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:58,025
big difference between the
non-voiced t and the voiced g.

630
00:32:58,025 --> 00:33:00,130
But that's only a guess because
I've only shown you a

631
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,900
fraction of the 14 distinctive
features that are involved.

632
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,952
So I suppose you like to
see a demonstration.

633
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,202
Yeah.

634
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,590
So there's our 14 features.

635
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,350
And that's our seed there,
sitting prominently in the

636
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,260
display with pluses and minuses
indicating the values

637
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,860
of the distinctive features
for all three

638
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,460
of the phones involved.

639
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,120
That funny left bracket
isn't a mistake.

640
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,060
That's just one convention for
rendering the ah sound in cat.

641
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,190
So it's pretty hard to tell from
just that matrix what's

642
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,400
going to be the determining
feature that separates the

643
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,630
positive examples from the
negative examples.

644
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,460
You notice that there
are actually two

645
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,250
examples down here.

646
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,460
There's cat and duck.

647
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,510
Is ducks got an s sound?

648
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:06,930
Ducks?

649
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,650
Yep.

650
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,420
So dogs and ducks.

651
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,400
They both get pluralized
with an s sound.

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,449
And then we have
beach doesn't.

653
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,840
That's beaches.

654
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,489
Dog.

655
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,389
We know that's a z.

656
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,040
Gun.

657
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,310
Gunz.

658
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,070
So that's not in the group.

659
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,900
So we can run this experiment.

660
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,699
Now here we go.

661
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,130
We're generalizing like crazy.

662
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,690
Generalizing, generalizing,
generalizing

663
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,150
from left to right.

664
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,810
So nothing in the first
two columns matters.

665
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,489
Now we get to the t.

666
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,440
Wow.

667
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,540
There it is.

668
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,489
So it looks like you pluralize
with a s sound.

669
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,780
The sss.

670
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,830
If, and only if, you're not
voiced and you're not strident

671
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,940
in the second to the last--

672
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,330
in the last phone
of the word that

673
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,400
you're trying to pluralize.

674
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,950
So that's one phonological
rule that

675
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,910
the system has learned.

676
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,330
And guess what?

677
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,520
It's the same rule
that's found in

678
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,636
phonological textbooks.

679
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,225
So now we can try another
experiment.

680
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,312
So this time we're trying to
deal with dog and gun.

681
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:19,630
And our negatives are what was
previously positive plus

682
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,016
beach, which is still in there
as a negative example.

683
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,320
So let's see how
that one works.

684
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,500
Nothing matters except for the
last column, the last phone.

685
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,390
And now we find out that if the
last sound is voiced, then

686
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,550
the pluralization gets the z
sound, a voiced determinator.

687
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,500
And finally, just to
deal with beaches.

688
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,710
That's beach in it's funny
phonetic spelling.

689
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:10,650
So now, if the final sound in
the word is strident, if its

690
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,430
got this jetty sound--

691
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,640
beach.

692
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,530
Beach.

693
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,840
Then it gets the ea sound.

694
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,570
So let's go back to experiment
number one.

695
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,620
Because I want to point out one
small thing about the way

696
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,180
this works.

697
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,190
You'll notice that it talks
about coverage and excluded

698
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,670
down here in the lower
left-hand corner.

699
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,180
Excluded, well, there are three
negative examples, so

700
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,630
they better all be excluded.

701
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,940
You don't want to cover
any of the negatives.

702
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,220
But it says coverage,
two and two.

703
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,120
That's because it actually
is doing--

704
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,530
and now we have the vocabulary
to say it quickly--

705
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:47,340
it's doing a beam search
through this space.

706
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,870
So it's not just doing
a depth first search.

707
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,840
It's doing a beam search so as
to reduce the possibility of

708
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,700
overlooking a solution.

709
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,980
So it says, oh, the coverage.

710
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,950
Both of the beam search elements
cover both of the

711
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,950
positive examples.

712
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,080
And they, in fact, have

713
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,850
converged to the same solution.

714
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,920
So that's how the Sussman
and Yip thing worked.

715
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,470
And then the next question
to ask is, of

716
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:16,136
course, why did it work?

717
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:20,610
And so the answer,
as articulated

718
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,270
by Sussman and Yip--

719
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,816
or rather more by Sussman.

720
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:28,290
Or rather more by Yip and a
little bit less by Sussman.

721
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,840
Yip thinks that it worked
because it's a sparse space.

722
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,110
And when you have a high
dimensional sparse space, it's

723
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,660
easy to put a hyperplane into
the space to separate one set

724
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,100
of examples for another
set of examples.

725
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,255
So let's consider the
following situation.

726
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:57,670
Suppose we have a
one-dimensional situation.

727
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,320
And we have two white
examples and we

728
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,670
have two purple examples.

729
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,700
Well, too bad for us you
can't separate them.

730
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,150
Now suppose that this is
actually the projection of a

731
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,280
two-dimensional space that
looks like this.

732
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Here are the white examples
down here.

733
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,910
And here are the purple
examples up here.

734
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,390
Now it's easy to see that you
can separate them with just a

735
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,810
line that goes across
like that.

736
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:34,420
Now let's take this one more
step and suppose that this is

737
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,326
actually a projection of a
three-dimensional space.

738
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:38,610
It looks like this.

739
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,240
This will be dimension one.

740
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,630
This'll be two going
back there.

741
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,900
And this will be
three up here.

742
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,560
And suppose that the positive
examples are right

743
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,810
here on this line.

744
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,980
Let's say this is-- well, we're
gonna draw a little old

745
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,960
cube like so.

746
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,420
Those are purple examples
that are up there.

747
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,150
How many ways are there of
partitioning the space along

748
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,830
those axes?

749
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,510
Well, now they're not
even just two.

750
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,940
They're three.

751
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,620
So one way to separate the
purple from the white is to

752
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,290
draw a hyperplane-- or in this
case it's a three dimension,

753
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,190
so a plane--

754
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,160
through here on the
number three axis.

755
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,010
You could also put a plane
in on that axis.

756
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,100
Or you could do both.

757
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,458
So in one case your dividing
line would be--

758
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:44,210
let's see.

759
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,240
On the first axis that
would be 1/2.

760
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,220
And then the don't care.

761
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,670
Don't care.

762
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,580
Another solution that
would be don't care.

763
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,830
And then we divide on the number
2 axis with a plane at

764
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,430
1/2 and don't care.

765
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,405
Or we could do it with 1/2,
1/2, and don't care.

766
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,990
So the higher the dimension of
the space, the easier it is

767
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:13,750
sometimes to put in a plane
that separates the data.

768
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,210
That's why Sussman and Yip think
that we use so little of

769
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,510
possible phoneme space.

770
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,910
Because it makes the
thing learnable.

771
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,920
That's one possibility.

772
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,090
So one explanation for sparse
space is learnability.

773
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,790
There's another interesting
possibility, and that is that

774
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,500
if you have a sparse space, high
dimensional space with 14

775
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,850
dimensions, and if the 40 points
of your language are

776
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,260
spread evenly throughout
that space--

777
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,490
now let me say it
the other way.

778
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,050
If they are placed at random in
that space, then according

779
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,190
to the central limit theorem,
then they'll be about equally

780
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,320
distant from each other.

781
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,050
So it ensures that the phonemes
are easily separated

782
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,870
when you speak.

783
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,480
But if you go to ask a linguist
if that's true, they

784
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,220
don't know.

785
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,240
Because they're not looking
at it from a

786
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,865
computational point of view.

787
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,840
Well, we can look at it from a
computational point of view.

788
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,860
So I did that.

789
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,940
After Sussman and Yip published
their paper.

790
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,190
And here's the result.

791
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,690
This is a diagram that shows all
of the phonemes that are

792
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,170
separated by exactly one
distinctive feature.

793
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,505
So if you look over in this
corner here, you'll see that

794
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:34,640
the constants-- w and x--

795
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,520
are separated by exactly one
distinctive feature.

796
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,110
So they're not exactly distant
from each other in the space.

797
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,020
On the other hand, they are
pretty easy to separate

798
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,960
relative to the vowels.

799
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,650
Which are here in this
part of the diagram.

800
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,230
Which are all tangled up and
the vowels are all close to

801
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,670
each other.

802
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,380
So guess what?

803
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,450
Vowels are much harder to
separate than constants.

804
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,710
Not surprisingly, because there
are many pairs of them

805
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,650
that are different.

806
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,914
And only one distinctive
feature.

807
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:05,580
All right.

808
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,380
So now you back up and
you say, well, gosh.

809
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,590
That's all been sort
of interesting.

810
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,180
But what does it teach
us about how to

811
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,062
do science and stuff?

812
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:14,990
And what it teaches us is--

813
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,320
this is an example.

814
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,570
Ow.

815
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,850
This is an example which we can
use to illuminate some of

816
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,030
thoughts of David Marr, who
I spoke of in a previous

817
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,882
lecture, connection
with vision.

818
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:36,560
But here's Marr's catechism.

819
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,930
I can't spell very well so I
won't try to respell it.

820
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,260
But this is Marr's catechism.

821
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,910
So what Marr said is, when
you're dealing with an AI

822
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,785
problem, first thing to do is
to specify the problem.

823
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:51,380
Gee, that sounds
awfully normal.

824
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,410
The next thing is to devise
a representation

825
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,660
suited to the problem.

826
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,130
The third thing to do,
vocabulary varies, but it's

827
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,980
something like determine
an approach.

828
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,395
Sometimes thought
of as a method.

829
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:28,048
And then four, pick a mechanism

830
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:29,380
or devise an algorithm.

831
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:38,710
And, finally, five,
experiment.

832
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,930
And of course, it never goes
linearly like that.

833
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,900
You start with the problem and
then you go through a lot of

834
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,570
loops up here.

835
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,215
Sometimes even changing
the problem.

836
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,320
But that's just the scientific
method, right?

837
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,950
You start with the problem
and you end up with the

838
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,250
experiment.

839
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:05,820
But that's not what people in
AI, over the bulk of its

840
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,050
existence, have tended to do.

841
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,300
What they tended to do is to
fall in love with particular

842
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,170
mechanisms.

843
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,470
And then they attempt
to apply those

844
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,690
mechanisms to every problem.

845
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,680
So you might say, well, gee,
neural nets are so cool.

846
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,545
I think all of human
intelligence can be explained

847
00:44:24,545 --> 00:44:27,170
with a suitable neural net.

848
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,645
That's not the right
way to do it.

849
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:30,130
Because that's mechanism envy.

850
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,275
You fall in love
with mechanism.

851
00:44:31,275 --> 00:44:34,760
You try to apply it where it
isn't the right thing.

852
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,350
This is example starting with
the problem and bringing to

853
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,880
the problem the right
representations, gosh,

854
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
distinctive features.

855
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,630
Once we've got the right
representation, then the

856
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,520
constraints emerge, which
enable us to devise an

857
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,100
approach, write an algorithm,
and do an experiment.

858
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,830
As they did.

859
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,560
So this Sussman-Yip thing is an
example of doing AI stuff

860
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,700
in a way that's congruent with
the Marr's catechism.

861
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,650
Which I highly recommend.

862
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,040
They could have come in here and
said, well, we're devotees

863
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,980
of the idea of neural nets.

864
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,480
Let's see if we can make a
machine that will properly

865
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,650
pluralize words using
a neural net.

866
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,370
That's a loser.

867
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,140
Because it doesn't match the
problem to the mechanism.

868
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,450
It tries to force fit the
mechanism into some

869
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,840
Procrustean bed where
it doesn't

870
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,820
actually work very well.

871
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,350
So what this leaves open, of
course, is the question of,

872
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,140
well, what is a good
representation?

873
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,910
And here's the other half
Marr's catechism.

874
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,300
Characteristic number one
is that it makes the

875
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,550
right things explicit.

876
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,280
So in this particular
case, it makes

877
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,750
distinctive features explicit.

878
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,340
Another thing that Marr was
noted for was stereo vision.

879
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:05,830
So in that particular world,
discontinuities in the image,

880
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,420
when you go across an
edge with the things

881
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,160
that were made explicit.

882
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,020
Once you've got to a
representation that makes the

883
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,850
right things explicit, you can
say, does it also expose

884
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,100
constraint?

885
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,320
And if you have a representation
that exposes

886
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,450
constraint, then you're
off and running.

887
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,690
Because it's constraint that
you need in order to do the

888
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,050
processing that leads
to a solution.

889
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,055
So don't have the right
representation.

890
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:38,080
If it doesn't expose
constraints, you're not going

891
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,930
to be able to make a very
good model out of it.

892
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:46,475
And finally, there's a kind
of localness criteria.

893
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,990
If you have a representation in
which you can see the right

894
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:55,780
answer by looking at
descriptions through soda

895
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,800
straw, that's probably a better
representation than one

896
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,700
that's all spread out.

897
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,185
It's true with programs,
right?

898
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,360
If you can see how they work
by looking through a soda

899
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,450
straw, you're in much better
situation to understand

900
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,770
something if you have to look
here and there and on the next

901
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,560
page and in the next file.

902
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,510
So all this is basically
common sense.

903
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,560
But this is kind of common sense
that makes you smarter

904
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,200
as an engineer and scientist.

905
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,080
Especially as a scientist
because if you go into a

906
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,850
problem with mechanism envy,
you're apt to study mechanisms

907
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,280
in a naive way and never reach
a solution that will be

908
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,530
satisfactory.

<p><span m="10560">PATRICK WINSTON: So today we're gonna talk about a few</span> <span m="15220">miracles of learning in the context of the theme that</span> <span m="19980">we're developing here in the class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24990">We started off with a discussion</span> <span m="31900">of some basic methods.</span> </p>
<p><span m="33260">We talked about nearest neighbors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="35610">And we talked about identification trees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="39250">And those are kind of basic things that have been around</span> <span m="41560">for a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="42740">Still useful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="43690">Still the right things to do when you're faced with a</span> <span m="46250">learning problem and you're not sure what method to try.</span> </p>
<p><span m="50840">Then we went on to talk about some naive biological mimicry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="55870">We talked about neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="60700">And we talked about genetic algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="65650">And you look at those things and you think and reflect back</span> <span m="68270">on what we talked about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69440">And you have to say to yourself, are</span> <span m="72010">these nugatory ideas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="74039">Perhaps pistareens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="75760">Or are they supererogatory ideas that deserve to be</span> <span m="79300">center stage?</span> </p>
<p><span m="84570">Does anybody know what those words mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="87770">A pistareen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="88780">Well, a pistareen is a Spanish coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="92000">It was so small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="92900">It was of little worth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="95130">These ideas like neural nets, genetic algorithms, I classify</span> <span m="103460">them as pistareens because getting them to do something</span> <span m="107820">is rather like getting a dog to walk on its hind legs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="111610">You can make it happen, but they never do it very well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="114700">And you have to think it took a lot of trickery and training</span> <span m="117000">to make it happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120795">So not too personally high on those ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="128150">But we teach them to you anyway because, of course, we</span> <span m="130620">only editorialize part of time and part of time we like to</span> <span m="134250">cover what's in the field.</span> </p>
<p><span m="137310">Today we're starting a couple of discussions of mechanisms</span> <span m="142460">or ideas or things to know about</span> <span m="146940">that are quite different.</span> </p>
<p><span m="147690">Because now we're going to focus on the problem rather</span> <span m="149690">than on the mechanism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="151930">And then a later on we're going to talk about deep</span> <span m="154120">theory, FIOS, for its own sake.</span> </p>
<p><span m="157005">But this week I want to talk about</span> <span m="158560">mechanisms that were devised.</span> </p>
<p><span m="162090">I want to talk about research that was done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="165760">Let me not say mechanisms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="167020">Let me say research that was done to attempt an account of</span> <span m="173530">some of the things that we humans do well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="176040">Sometimes without even knowing that we do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="180460">Now Krishna here tells me his first language was Telugu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="185750">Telugu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="186790">I once had another student whose first</span> <span m="188270">language was Telugu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="190160">I said to him, that must be one of those</span> <span m="192100">obscure Indian languages.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194480">And he said, yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="195470">It's spoken by 56 million people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="198570">French is spoken by 52.</span> </p>
<p><span m="199756">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="202202">PATRICK WINSTON: He's going to be our experimental subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="204650">Krishna, if I pluralize words-- you know what it means</span> <span m="208040">to pluralize a word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="210120">So if I say for example, horse, then if I ask you for</span> <span m="215595">the plural you'll say horses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="218220">So if I say dog, what's the plural?</span> </p>
<p><span m="222500">STUDENT: Then dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="224380">Or in my language?</span> </p>
<p><span m="225222">PATRICK WINSTON: No, no, no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="225730">In English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="226680">STUDENT: Oh, dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227680">PATRICK WINSTON: Well, what about cat?</span> </p>
<p><span m="228977">STUDENT: Cats.</span> </p>
<p><span m="229771">PATRICK WINSTON: And he got it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="230950">Isn't that a miracle?</span> </p>
<p><span m="232250">When did you start speaking English?</span> </p>
<p><span m="234570">STUDENT: Second grade.</span> </p>
<p><span m="235560">PATRICK WINSTON: Second grade.</span> </p>
<p><span m="236190">But he still got it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="237600">But he never learned that he's actually pluralizing those</span> <span m="240740">words differently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="242790">But he is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="245320">So when you pluralize dog, what's the</span> <span m="248090">sound that comes after?</span> </p>
<p><span m="250600">It's a z sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="251770">Zzzzzz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="252870">Dogzzz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="254710">If you stick your fingers up here you can probably feel</span> <span m="256902">your vocal cords vibrating.</span> </p>
<p><span m="258428">If you stick a piece of paper in front of your mouth you'll</span> <span m="261040">see it vibrate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="263000">But when you say cats, the pluralizing sound</span> <span m="266260">is sss, like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="268710">No vocalizing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="269920">No vibration of the vocal cords.</span> </p>
<p><span m="272113">And old Krishna here learned that rule, as did all of you</span> <span m="275510">other non-native speakers of English, effortlessly and</span> <span m="278330">without noticing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="279190">You learned it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="280335">Buy you always get it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="281650">How can that possibly be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="284170">Well, be the end of hour you'll know how that might be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="287250">And you'll experience a case study in how questions of that</span> <span m="294060">sort can be approached with a sort of</span> <span m="295909">engineering point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="297159">You can say, what if God were an engineer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="299680">Or alternatively, what if I were God and I am an engineer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="304730">Think about how it might happen that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="307810">So we want to understand how it might be that the machine</span> <span m="313150">could learn rules like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="314700">Phonological rules.</span> </p>
<p><span m="315690">Not just that one, but all the phonological rules you'd</span> <span m="319200">acquire in a course on phonology.</span> </p>
<p><span m="321540">That part of speaking that deals with those syllabic and</span> <span m="327990">sub-syllabic sounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="330740">The phones of the language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="332970">So when Yip and Sussman undertook to solve this</span> <span m="337890">engineering problem, both being dedicated engineers, the</span> <span m="341950">first thing they did was learn the science.</span> </p>
<p><span m="344560">So they went to sit at the foot of Morris Halle, who</span> <span m="347840">would develop-- was largely responsible for the</span> <span m="351510">development theories of</span> <span m="353280">so-called distinctive features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="354940">And here's how all that works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357200">You start off with a person who wants to say something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="363900">And out that person's mouth comes some sort of acoustic</span> <span m="369650">pressure wave.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371670">And if I say, hello, George.</span> </p>
<p><span m="374780">And you say hello, George.</span> </p>
<p><span m="376560">Everybody will understand that we said the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="379120">But that acoustic waveform won't look anything alike.</span> </p>
<p><span m="381540">It'll be very different for all of us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="384790">So it's a miracle that words can be understood.</span> </p>
<p><span m="389310">In any case, it goes into an ear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="392240">And it's processed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="394240">And out comes a sequence of distinctive feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="411440">Vectors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="418120">A distinctive feature is a binary variable like is the</span> <span m="424170">phone voices or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="425880">That is to say, are your vocal cords vibrating</span> <span m="427830">when you say it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="428840">If so, then that's plus voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431970">If not, it's minus voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="434360">So according to the original distinctive feature theory and</span> <span m="439440">consistent with most of the theories that have been</span> <span m="442650">derived since the original one, there are on the order of</span> <span m="445740">14 of these distinctive features that determine which</span> <span m="449300">phone you're saying.</span> </p>
<p><span m="452090">So if you say ah, that's one combination of</span> <span m="455260">these binary features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="456715">If you say tuh, that's another combination of</span> <span m="460659">these binary features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="462659">14 of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="465040">So how many sounds does that mean, in principle, there</span> <span m="468909">could be in a language?</span> </p>
<p><span m="470770">SEBASTIAN: 2 to the 14th.</span> </p>
<p><span m="472165">PATRICK WINSTON: And what's 2 the 14th, Sebastian?</span> </p>
<p><span m="478300">Well, it ought to be about 16,000, don't you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="481920">2 to the 10th is 1,000.</span> </p>
<p><span m="483350">2 the fourth is 16.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485310">So there are about 16,000 possible combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="489480">But no language on Earth has more than 100 phones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="494100">That's strange, isn't it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="494910">Because some of those choices are probably excluded on</span> <span m="498670">physical ground.</span> </p>
<p><span m="499390">But most of them are not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="500730">So we could have a lot more phones in our language than we</span> <span m="503870">actually do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="504780">English is about 40.</span> </p>
<p><span m="507630">So the sequence of distinctive features could be viewed as</span> <span m="512070">then producing meaning after, perhaps, a long series of</span> <span m="521090">operations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522620">But in the end, those operations feedback in here</span> <span m="526730">because many of the distinctive features are</span> <span m="528560">actually hallucinated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="530560">We think we heard them, but they're not there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532320">Or they're not even in the acoustic waveform.</span> </p>
<p><span m="535480">They're there for the convenience of the phonologist</span> <span m="537345">who make rules out of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="541210">It's remarkable how much of this feedback there is, and</span> <span m="550670">even injection from other modalities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="554570">Many of you may have heard about the McGurk Effect.</span> </p>
<p><span m="557730">Here's who the McGurk Effect works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="560310">Look at me while I say ga, ga, ga, ga, ga, ga.</span> </p>
<p><span m="565270">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="565580">I said, g-a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="567120">Now how about ba, ba, ba, ba.</span> </p>
<p><span m="570050">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="570460">I said ba like a sheep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="575130">But if I take the sound I make when I say ba and play it</span> <span m="580730">while you're taking video of me saying ga, what do you</span> <span m="584730">think you hear?</span> </p>
<p><span m="586840">You don't hear ba.</span> </p>
<p><span m="588000">Some people report that they hear a d-a sound like da.</span> </p>
<p><span m="593030">When I look at it, I can't make any sense out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="596200">It looks like there's a disconnection between the</span> <span m="598270">speech and the video.</span> </p>
<p><span m="601470">But it does not sound like ba.</span> </p>
<p><span m="603916">But if I shut my eyes and say ba, ba, it's absolutely clear</span> <span m="607740">that it's b-a.</span> </p>
<p><span m="610350">So what you see has a large influence on what you hear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="617280">It's also interesting--</span> <span m="618600">although a side issue-- it's also interesting to note that</span> <span m="620690">it's very difficult pronounced things correctly if you don't</span> <span m="623350">see the speaker.</span> </p>
<p><span m="625230">So many people wonder when they learn foreign languages</span> <span m="627360">why they can't speak like a native.</span> </p>
<p><span m="629600">And the answer is, they're not watching the</span> <span m="631020">mouth of the speaker.</span> </p>
<p><span m="633160">I was talking to a German friend once and said, you</span> <span m="635665">know, I just can't say the damned umlaut right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="639796">And he said, oh, the trouble with you Americans is you</span> <span m="642470">don't realize that American cows say moo but</span> <span m="647080">German cows say muu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="648530">[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m="648910">PATRICK WINSTON: And, of course, I got instantly</span> <span m="651130">because I could see that the umlaut sounds are produced</span> <span m="653410">with protruding lips, which we don't have any sounds an</span> <span m="657290">English that require that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="659766">Ah, but back to what we know from the phonologists about</span> <span m="663180">all this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="664450">If you talk to Morris Halle, he will tell</span> <span m="666740">you that over here--</span> <span m="669490">I like to think of it as a marionette.</span> </p>
<p><span m="672100">There are five pieces of meat down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="681270">And the combination of distinctive features that</span> <span m="683330">you're trying to utter are like the control of a</span> <span m="687250">marionette on those five pieces of meat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="689320">So if you want to say an a sound, the marionette control</span> <span m="692020">goes into a position that produces that combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="696310">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="696970">What does that distinctive feature sequence look like for</span> <span m="701110">typical word?</span> </p>
<p><span m="701920">Well, here's a word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="704020">A-e-p-l.</span> </p>
<p><span m="708250">Apples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="710340">And we can talk about what distinctive features are</span> <span m="716580">arrayed in that particular combination of phones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="721380">So one of the features that they like to</span> <span m="723040">talk about is syllabic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="725580">Syllabic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="729950">That roughly means, can that sound form the sort of core of</span> <span m="733240">a syllable?</span> </p>
<p><span m="734710">And the answer is a can, buy these can't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738930">So it's plus, minus, minus, minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="742060">Down here a little ways you'll run into the voiced feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="749040">And for the voiced feature, well, we can do</span> <span m="750735">the experiment ourselves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="752160">Ahh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753500">Sounds like it's voices to me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="755540">Pa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="756340">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="756790">That's not voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757970">Oo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="758390">Yep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="759080">Zzz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="760540">We already said that was voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="763180">So that's the combination you see when you utter apples for</span> <span m="766940">the voiced feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="768670">Then another one is the continuent one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774190">That roughly says is your vocal apparatus open?</span> </p>
<p><span m="777290">Is there no obstruction?</span> </p>
<p><span m="780370">And so ahh plus pa is constricted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="784750">Oo, open.</span> </p>
<p><span m="786100">Zzz, open.</span> </p>
<p><span m="787960">So that one happens to run right along with voiced in</span> <span m="789960">that particular word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="792040">Oh, and there are 14 altogether.</span> </p>
<p><span m="793640">But let me just write down one more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="796510">The strident one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801980">That says, do you use your tongue to form a</span> <span m="805000">little jet of air?</span> </p>
<p><span m="806800">So you don't on aa, pa, oo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="810735">Buy you do on z.</span> </p>
<p><span m="813220">So that gets a plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815600">So that's a glimpse through a soda straw of what it would</span> <span m="819530">like to represent the word apples as a set of distinctive</span> <span m="823980">features all arranged in a sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="826350">So it's a matrix of features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829760">Going down in the columns we have our distinctive features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="832750">And going across we have time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="836250">So as the first thing Sussman and Yip did in their effort to</span> <span m="841230">understand how phonological rules could be learned is to</span> <span m="844610">design a machine that would interpret words and sounds and</span> <span m="851880">things that you see so as to produce the</span> <span m="856260">sounds of the language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="858470">So they imagined the following kind of machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="861820">The machine has some kind of mystery apparatus over here</span> <span m="867320">that looks out into the world and sees what's there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="871290">So I'm looking out in the world and I see two apples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="874570">So what this machine might do then is, at some point, decide</span> <span m="879090">that there are two apples out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="881490">Then, thinking in terms of these guys as computer</span> <span m="884340">engineers, they think in terms of a set of registers that</span> <span m="890460">hold values for concepts like noun and verb and plural.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902500">And we've not done anything with the machine yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905130">We've provided no input.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907520">So those registers are all empty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="912260">Then, up in here, we have a set of words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="920763">And they're all kinds of words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="923470">Apple is one of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="929290">And those words up there know about how the concept is</span> <span m="934540">rendered as a sequence of a phones, that is to say a</span> <span m="937990">sequence of distinct features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="941430">Then, over here, most importantly, they have a set</span> <span m="946450">of constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955660">So we'll talk about a particular constrain, the</span> <span m="958050">plural constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="961690">Plural constraint number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="965380">And it's going to reach around and connect itself to some</span> <span m="968040">other parts of the machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970570">Finally, there's a buffer of phones to be uttered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="977470">And they're going to flow out this way to the speaker's</span> <span m="980650">mouth and get translated into a acoustic wave form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="986770">So those are the elements of the machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="989680">Now how are the elements connected together?</span> </p>
<p><span m="994380">Well, the words are connected, of course, into the buffer</span> <span m="1007460">that is used to generate the sound over</span> <span m="1011550">here on the far left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1014360">The plural register is connected to what</span> <span m="1018150">you see in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020080">What you see in the world is connected not only to plural</span> <span m="1022580">register, but to all of the objects in the word</span> <span m="1028530">repertoire.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1032530">This plural constraint here deserves extra attention</span> <span m="1035950">because it's going to be desirous of actuating itself</span> <span m="1041868">in the event but the thing observed in</span> <span m="1043839">the world is plural.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1045630">There are lots of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1048520">So it's going to be connected then to the plural port.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1055430">There's going to be a z sound port down here connecting to</span> <span m="1060050">that file element in the buffer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066710">And finally, over here is going to be a plussed voiced</span> <span m="1073430">port, which is going to be connected to the second</span> <span m="1078370">phoneme in the sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1081270">That's how the machine is going to be arranged.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1084130">An of course, this is just one of many constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1087630">But it's a constraint that has a very peculiar property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1092410">Information can flow through it in multiple ways.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1096410">So we think of most programs as having an</span> <span m="1098430">input and an output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1101430">But I try to be careful to draw circles</span> <span m="1104630">here instead of arrows.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105560">Because these are ports and information can flow in any</span> <span m="1109170">direction along them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1110890">What I want to do now is to show you how this machine</span> <span m="1113240">would react if I suddenly present it with a pair of</span> <span m="1117540">apples like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1120570">So the assumption is that the vision apparatus comes in and</span> <span m="1124740">produces the notion, the concept, of two apples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1131140">So once that has happened--</span> <span m="1134690">that's operation number one--</span> <span m="1139370">then information flows from that meaning register up here</span> <span m="1144850">to the apple word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1146810">So that's part of stage number two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1151700">Another part of stage number two is information flows along</span> <span m="1154240">this wire and marks that as plus plural.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1161200">So operation number one is the activity of the vision system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165290">Activity number two is the flow of information from that</span> <span m="1168770">vision system into the word lexicon and</span> <span m="1173010">into this plural register.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1177690">So far so good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1178900">Here's activity number three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1182560">This word is also connected to the registers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189850">And information flows along those wires so as to indicate</span> <span m="1193900">that it's a noun but not a verb.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1196860">That's part of part number three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1200640">At the same time, part number three, information flows down</span> <span m="1205050">this wire and writes a-p-l into those are</span> <span m="1211000">elements of the buffer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1215940">Now this constraint up here, this box, says, well, I can</span> <span m="1220490">now see some stuff in that buffer that</span> <span m="1222480">wasn't there before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1224430">So it says, do I see enough stuff on my ports to get</span> <span m="1228410">excited about expressing values on other ports?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233300">Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233730">What has it got?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1234780">It's got the elements in this buffer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1238890">Also up here in step three flow the plural thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1242270">So it know that the word is plural.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1244400">So it says, is this voiced?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1248330">P is pa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1250130">That's not voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1251920">Is this a z sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1253180">No, that's not as z sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1255410">So it sees what it likes on only one of its three ports.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1259930">So it says, I'm not going to do anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1261750">I'm [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1263500">I'm not in this particular combat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1267370">So far so good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1268440">What happens next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1270460">What happens next is that some time passes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1275100">And the elements of the buffer flow to the left toward the</span> <span m="1278780">speaker's mouth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1280820">So we get an a, p, l.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1284720">Same as we had before, but shifted over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1287700">Now what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1291110">Now what happens is that the l is now in</span> <span m="1295870">the penultimate position.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1297680">So information flows up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1300100">Item number four-- oh, I guess that's item number five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1303860">Item number four is the leftward flow of the word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1308290">So in phase number five, the p is witnessed by this</span> <span m="1311360">constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1312990">p is--</span> <span m="1314210">sorry, l is witnessed by this constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1315990">We moved it over one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1317950">L is lll.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318850">L is voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1320570">So we have some flow up here like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1323940">That's number five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1326470">Now we have voiced and we have plural.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1330640">And we have nothing here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1332940">So there's a great desire of this buffer to have something</span> <span m="1336340">written into it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1337500">So now there's a flow down in there, of z,</span> <span m="1341370">as item number six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1343170">So that's how the machine would work in expressing the</span> <span m="1346730">idea that there are apples in the field of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355196">Mmm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1356610">Real apples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1357720">Not plastic imitations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1362870">So that's how the machine works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1366140">But all those connections are reversible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1371100">So if I hear apples then I get the machine running backwards</span> <span m="1376545">and my visual apparatus can imagine that there</span> <span m="1380025">are apples out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1381692">That's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384030">That's just by way of background the machine that</span> <span m="1387090">they could see it for using the phonological rules once</span> <span m="1390490">they're learned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391880">All the phonological rules are expressed in these</span> <span m="1395400">constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1397710">But since these constraints are such that information can</span> <span m="1400270">flow in any direction, they deserve to be called</span> <span m="1402990">propagators.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410290">And in the good old days when everyone took 6.001, they</span> <span m="1413760">learned about propagators as a kind of architecture for</span> <span m="1417370">building complex systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420380">But in any event, there's the Sussman-Yip machine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1423060">And now comes the big question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1424600">How do you learn rule rules like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1429010">Well, what we need is we need some positive examples and</span> <span m="1432120">some negative examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1436910">And for the simple classroom example I've chosen the same</span> <span m="1440210">challenge that I presented to Krishna.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443780">We're gonna have cats and dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1446730">So we're gonna look at the distinctive features that are</span> <span m="1450340">associated with those words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1455220">Syllabic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1457020">Voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1460050">Continuent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1465510">And strident.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470740">Just four of the 14 features that are associated with each</span> <span m="1474130">of the sounds on those words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475940">Could you close the laptop, please?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1480680">Just for the distinctive features that are arrayed in</span> <span m="1487375">those words by way of illustration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1491160">So here we have k-a-t-z.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1496450">Phonetically spelled.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1504050">And if we work that out, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1506810">What is syllabic?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1508460">That's not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1508900">That is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509450">That is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511060">That's not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514090">Voiced?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514610">Ka.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1515170">Nope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516204">Ah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1516648">Yep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1517980">T. Nope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1519570">Z. Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521540">That can't be right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1522660">Cats.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1525070">I misspelled it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526610">Because cats.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1527225">Sss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1528310">His a hissing sound but there's no voicing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1531590">So that's not as z sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532910">That's an s sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535780">So that's not plus voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1536960">It's minused voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1538860">Continuent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1540980">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1541670">Is my mouth open when I say k?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1543180">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1544120">Ah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1544420">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1545790">T?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546280">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1547660">S?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1548110">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549860">And strident.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550870">Minus, minus, minus, plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1553120">It's only with the s sound that I have that kind of jet</span> <span m="1556650">forming with my tongue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1559270">Now we can look at dogs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1571950">And now we have the z sound as the pluralization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1576450">We know that because when we say it, dogzz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1578230">Yep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1578700">There it comes out as a--</span> <span m="1580450">we're only gonna look at the last two columns because</span> <span m="1583770">they're the only ones that are going to matter to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1585640">So that's plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1587960">And that's minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1590906">Gu, gu, gu, gu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1596330">That's plussed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1597240">And that's plussed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1598220">They're both voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1599230">Is that right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1599730">Dogu?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1601800">Gu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602700">Gu.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1603170">Is g sound voiced?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611430">Yeah, I didn't think so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1613156">G sound is voiced?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1623420">Look-- oh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1624223">Oh, it is voiced buy it's not a continuent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1628072">Just like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1630400">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1631270">Cat, dogu zz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632280">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632645">It is voiced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1633760">And it has to be for my example to work out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636276">And that's minus, minus, minus, plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1640390">So what we're interested in is, how come one word gets an</span> <span m="1642870">s sound and how come the other words gets a z sound?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1648080">Well, it's a pretty sparse space out there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1651290">We've already decided that there are 14,000 possible</span> <span m="1654670">phonemes and there are only 40 in the language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1657640">So that's one thing we can consider.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1660310">The other thing that we can think is that, well, maybe</span> <span m="1664800">this is a logical problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1666100">Like the kind of problem you'd face if you</span> <span m="1667556">were designing a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1669470">And so Sussman and Yip got stuck for three months</span> <span m="1671870">thinking about the problem that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1674250">Couldn't make any progress whatsoever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1676050">And that happens a lot when you're doing a search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1678920">You think you've got a way of approaching it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681940">Try to make it work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1683210">You stay up all night.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1685300">Stay up all night again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1686550">Still can't make it work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1688310">Eventually, you abandon ship and try something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1691222">So then they began to say, well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694820">All we care about is the stuff before the two ending sounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1698880">We care about that part of the matrix.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702580">And we care about that part of the matrix.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1705250">And we can ask, in what ways are those things different?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1709730">And they're different all over the place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1711150">That's why they're different words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1713090">We can ask the question a little bit differently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714730">And we can say, what can we not care about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1718380">And still retain enough of an understanding of how the words</span> <span m="1721860">are different so as to put the proper plural ending on them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1726990">And they worried about that for a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1729075">Couldn't find a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1730250">The search space was too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1732840">And then they said, maybe what we ought to do is we ought to</span> <span m="1737160">think about generalizing this guy here so that we</span> <span m="1740550">don't care about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1743640">So now we don't care about that guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1746080">And then he went down through here saying, well, let's see</span> <span m="1749220">when we have to stop generalizing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1751740">Because we've screwed everything up and we can no</span> <span m="1755790">longer keep the z sound words separated</span> <span m="1759200">from the s sound words.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762470">So that eventually distilled itself down to</span> <span m="1764240">the following algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1769710">First thing they did was to collect positive</span> <span m="1777010">and negative examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1783760">And there's a positive example and a negative example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1786870">That's not enough to do it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1788250">But that's enough to illustrate the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1791960">So the next thing they did was something that's extremely</span> <span m="1795060">common in learning anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1797930">And that is to pick a positive example to start from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1801950">It's actually not a bad idea in learning anything to start</span> <span m="1805900">with a positive example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808650">So they picked a positive example and they</span> <span m="1810480">called that a seed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1820990">So in our particular case, cats is going to be our seed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1826070">And the question we're going to ask is, what are the words</span> <span m="1829700">that get pluralized like cat?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834530">So we've got a positive and negative example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837350">We've picked a seed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1838890">And now, the next step is to generalize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847370">And what I mean by generalize is you pick some places in the</span> <span m="1850360">phoneme matrix that you just don't care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1854160">So you may pick a positive example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1856710">And you don't care about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1858100">So you change it to an asterisk or, as demonstrated</span> <span m="1861960">in the program I'm about show you, a ball.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864600">Or you pick one that's negative and you</span> <span m="1868820">turn it to a ball.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1870240">Bo.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1871630">So cats, this seed, becomes a pattern.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1875210">And in order to pluralize the word this way, you have to</span> <span m="1878470">match all the stuff in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1880100">But now what we're going to do is we're going to gradually</span> <span m="1882390">turn some of those elements into don't care symbols until</span> <span m="1888860">we get to a point where we've not cared about so much stuff</span> <span m="1892910">that we think that we pluralize that one</span> <span m="1894470">with an s sound too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1897200">So we keep generalizing until we cover, that is to say we</span> <span m="1906100">admit or match, a negative example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1910561">So that's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1913070">So we generalize like crazy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1914980">And as soon as we cover a negative example, we quit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1921910">Otherwise, we just go back up here and generalize some more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1928410">And now we've got to pick a search technique to decide</span> <span m="1932670">which of these guys to actually generalize when.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1938130">We could pick one at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1940940">And they tried that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1941870">It didn't work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943641">So what they decided is that the thing that influences the</span> <span m="1946440">pluralization most is the adjacent phoneme.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1949740">And if that isn't the thing that solves the problem, it'll</span> <span m="1952240">be the one next to that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1953760">So in other words, the closer you are, the more likely you</span> <span m="1955837">are to determine the outcome.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1957800">So these guys over here are least likely to matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1961770">And those are the ones that are generalized first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1966390">So if we do that, what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1970390">Looks like we're going to come in here and see that there's a</span> <span m="1973050">big difference between the non-voiced t and the voiced g.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1978025">But that's only a guess because I've only shown you a</span> <span m="1980130">fraction of the 14 distinctive features that are involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1984900">So I suppose you like to see a demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1987952">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005180">So there's our 14 features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2007590">And that's our seed there, sitting prominently in the</span> <span m="2011350">display with pluses and minuses indicating the values</span> <span m="2015260">of the distinctive features for all three</span> <span m="2016860">of the phones involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018460">That funny left bracket isn't a mistake.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2020120">That's just one convention for rendering the ah sound in cat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2030510">So it's pretty hard to tell from just that matrix what's</span> <span m="2033190">going to be the determining feature that separates the</span> <span m="2037400">positive examples from the negative examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2039630">You notice that there are actually two</span> <span m="2041460">examples down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2042250">There's cat and duck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2044460">Is ducks got an s sound?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2046510">Ducks?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2046930">Yep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048650">So dogs and ducks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2051420">They both get pluralized with an s sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2054400">And then we have beach doesn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055449">That's beaches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057840">Dog.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2058489">We know that's a z.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060389">Gun.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2061040">Gunz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2062310">So that's not in the group.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2065070">So we can run this experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2066900">Now here we go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2067699">We're generalizing like crazy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2069130">Generalizing, generalizing, generalizing</span> <span m="2070690">from left to right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2073150">So nothing in the first two columns matters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075810">Now we get to the t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2078489">Wow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079440">There it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080540">So it looks like you pluralize with a s sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2083489">The sss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085780">If, and only if, you're not voiced and you're not strident</span> <span m="2091830">in the second to the last--</span> <span m="2094940">in the last phone of the word that</span> <span m="2096330">you're trying to pluralize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2099400">So that's one phonological rule that</span> <span m="2100950">the system has learned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2101910">And guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2102330">It's the same rule that's found in</span> <span m="2103520">phonological textbooks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2105636">So now we can try another experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113290">So this time we're trying to deal with dog and gun.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2116312">And our negatives are what was previously positive plus</span> <span m="2119630">beach, which is still in there as a negative example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2123016">So let's see how that one works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2132050">Nothing matters except for the last column, the last phone.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2136500">And now we find out that if the last sound is voiced, then</span> <span m="2141390">the pluralization gets the z sound, a voiced determinator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2146550">And finally, just to deal with beaches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2149500">That's beach in it's funny phonetic spelling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164410">So now, if the final sound in the word is strident, if its</span> <span m="2170650">got this jetty sound--</span> <span m="2172430">beach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2173640">Beach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2175530">Then it gets the ea sound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178840">So let's go back to experiment number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2181570">Because I want to point out one small thing about the way</span> <span m="2184620">this works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2186180">You'll notice that it talks about coverage and excluded</span> <span m="2188190">down here in the lower left-hand corner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190670">Excluded, well, there are three negative examples, so</span> <span m="2193180">they better all be excluded.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2194630">You don't want to cover any of the negatives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2196940">But it says coverage, two and two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199220">That's because it actually is doing--</span> <span m="2202120">and now we have the vocabulary to say it quickly--</span> <span m="2204530">it's doing a beam search through this space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207340">So it's not just doing a depth first search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2208870">It's doing a beam search so as to reduce the possibility of</span> <span m="2212840">overlooking a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2214700">So it says, oh, the coverage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2216980">Both of the beam search elements cover both of the</span> <span m="2221950">positive examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2222950">And they, in fact, have</span> <span m="2224080">converged to the same solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2226850">So that's how the Sussman and Yip thing worked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230920">And then the next question to ask is, of</span> <span m="2232470">course, why did it work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236136">And so the answer, as articulated</span> <span m="2240610">by Sussman and Yip--</span> <span m="2243270">or rather more by Sussman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244816">Or rather more by Yip and a little bit less by Sussman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2248290">Yip thinks that it worked because it's a sparse space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2251840">And when you have a high dimensional sparse space, it's</span> <span m="2255110">easy to put a hyperplane into the space to separate one set</span> <span m="2259660">of examples for another set of examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2262100">So let's consider the following situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271390">Suppose we have a one-dimensional situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277670">And we have two white examples and we</span> <span m="2282320">have two purple examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2285670">Well, too bad for us you can't separate them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2289700">Now suppose that this is actually the projection of a</span> <span m="2293150">two-dimensional space that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297280">Here are the white examples down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300280">And here are the purple examples up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2304910">Now it's easy to see that you can separate them with just a</span> <span m="2307390">line that goes across like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2309810">Now let's take this one more step and suppose that this is</span> <span m="2314420">actually a projection of a three-dimensional space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2317326">It looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2321610">This will be dimension one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2323240">This'll be two going back there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2326630">And this will be three up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2329900">And suppose that the positive examples are right</span> <span m="2333560">here on this line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2341120">Let's say this is-- well, we're gonna draw a little old</span> <span m="2343980">cube like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345960">Those are purple examples that are up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2350420">How many ways are there of partitioning the space along</span> <span m="2353150">those axes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353830">Well, now they're not even just two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356510">They're three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2357940">So one way to separate the purple from the white is to</span> <span m="2363620">draw a hyperplane-- or in this case it's a three dimension,</span> <span m="2368290">so a plane--</span> <span m="2369190">through here on the number three axis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2373160">You could also put a plane in on that axis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376010">Or you could do both.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2378100">So in one case your dividing line would be--</span> <span m="2383458">let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2384210">On the first axis that would be 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2387240">And then the don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389220">Don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390670">Another solution that would be don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393580">And then we divide on the number 2 axis with a plane at</span> <span m="2397830">1/2 and don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400430">Or we could do it with 1/2, 1/2, and don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407405">So the higher the dimension of the space, the easier it is</span> <span m="2410990">sometimes to put in a plane that separates the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2413750">That's why Sussman and Yip think that we use so little of</span> <span m="2417210">possible phoneme space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2418510">Because it makes the thing learnable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420910">That's one possibility.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2423920">So one explanation for sparse space is learnability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2430090">There's another interesting possibility, and that is that</span> <span m="2433790">if you have a sparse space, high dimensional space with 14</span> <span m="2437500">dimensions, and if the 40 points of your language are</span> <span m="2442850">spread evenly throughout that space--</span> <span m="2446260">now let me say it the other way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2447490">If they are placed at random in that space, then according</span> <span m="2451050">to the central limit theorem, then they'll be about equally</span> <span m="2453190">distant from each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2455320">So it ensures that the phonemes are easily separated</span> <span m="2459050">when you speak.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2461870">But if you go to ask a linguist if that's true, they</span> <span m="2466480">don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2467220">Because they're not looking at it from a</span> <span m="2468240">computational point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2469865">Well, we can look at it from a computational point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2472840">So I did that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474860">After Sussman and Yip published their paper.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2476940">And here's the result.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2481330">This is a diagram that shows all of the phonemes that are</span> <span m="2486690">separated by exactly one distinctive feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490170">So if you look over in this corner here, you'll see that</span> <span m="2492505">the constants-- w and x--</span> <span m="2494640">are separated by exactly one distinctive feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2498520">So they're not exactly distant from each other in the space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2503110">On the other hand, they are pretty easy to separate</span> <span m="2505020">relative to the vowels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2506960">Which are here in this part of the diagram.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2509650">Which are all tangled up and the vowels are all close to</span> <span m="2512230">each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2512670">So guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514380">Vowels are much harder to separate than constants.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517450">Not surprisingly, because there are many pairs of them</span> <span m="2520710">that are different.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521650">And only one distinctive feature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2524914">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2525580">So now you back up and you say, well, gosh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527380">That's all been sort of interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528590">But what does it teach us about how to</span> <span m="2531180">do science and stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533062">And what it teaches us is--</span> <span m="2534990">this is an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2537320">Ow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2544360">This is an example which we can use to illuminate some of</span> <span m="2547850">thoughts of David Marr, who I spoke of in a previous</span> <span m="2550030">lecture, connection with vision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2552882">But here's Marr's catechism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2556560">I can't spell very well so I won't try to respell it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2558930">But this is Marr's catechism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2561260">So what Marr said is, when you're dealing with an AI</span> <span m="2563910">problem, first thing to do is to specify the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568425">Gee, that sounds awfully normal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2571380">The next thing is to devise a representation</span> <span m="2577410">suited to the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582660">The third thing to do, vocabulary varies, but it's</span> <span m="2586130">something like determine an approach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2591660">Sometimes thought of as a method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597080">And then four, pick a mechanism</span> <span m="2608048">or devise an algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2616210">And, finally, five, experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625840">And of course, it never goes linearly like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2628930">You start with the problem and then you go through a lot of</span> <span m="2631900">loops up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2632570">Sometimes even changing the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2636740">But that's just the scientific method, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2638320">You start with the problem and you end up with the</span> <span m="2639950">experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2641250">But that's not what people in AI, over the bulk of its</span> <span m="2645820">existence, have tended to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2649050">What they tended to do is to fall in love with particular</span> <span m="2653300">mechanisms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2655170">And then they attempt to apply those</span> <span m="2656470">mechanisms to every problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2658690">So you might say, well, gee, neural nets are so cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2661680">I think all of human intelligence can be explained</span> <span m="2664545">with a suitable neural net.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2667170">That's not the right way to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2668645">Because that's mechanism envy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670130">You fall in love with mechanism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2671275">You try to apply it where it isn't the right thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2674760">This is example starting with the problem and bringing to</span> <span m="2678350">the problem the right representations, gosh,</span> <span m="2680880">distinctive features.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2682840">Once we've got the right representation, then the</span> <span m="2685630">constraints emerge, which enable us to devise an</span> <span m="2688520">approach, write an algorithm, and do an experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2691100">As they did.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2692830">So this Sussman-Yip thing is an example of doing AI stuff</span> <span m="2698560">in a way that's congruent with the Marr's catechism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2702700">Which I highly recommend.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2704650">They could have come in here and said, well, we're devotees</span> <span m="2708040">of the idea of neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2710980">Let's see if we can make a machine that will properly</span> <span m="2714480">pluralize words using a neural net.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2717650">That's a loser.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2719370">Because it doesn't match the problem to the mechanism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722140">It tries to force fit the mechanism into some</span> <span m="2725450">Procrustean bed where it doesn't</span> <span m="2728840">actually work very well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2731820">So what this leaves open, of course, is the question of,</span> <span m="2734350">well, what is a good representation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2739140">And here's the other half Marr's catechism.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741910">Characteristic number one is that it makes the</span> <span m="2745300">right things explicit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2749540">So in this particular case, it makes</span> <span m="2751280">distinctive features explicit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754750">Another thing that Marr was noted for was stereo vision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2759340">So in that particular world, discontinuities in the image,</span> <span m="2765830">when you go across an edge with the things</span> <span m="2767420">that were made explicit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2770160">Once you've got to a representation that makes the</span> <span m="2772020">right things explicit, you can say, does it also expose</span> <span m="2775850">constraint?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2785730">And if you have a representation that exposes</span> <span m="2787320">constraint, then you're off and running.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2788450">Because it's constraint that you need in order to do the</span> <span m="2790690">processing that leads to a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795050">So don't have the right representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2796055">If it doesn't expose constraints, you're not going</span> <span m="2798080">to be able to make a very good model out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2800930">And finally, there's a kind of localness criteria.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809730">If you have a representation in which you can see the right</span> <span m="2812990">answer by looking at descriptions through soda</span> <span m="2815780">straw, that's probably a better representation than one</span> <span m="2817800">that's all spread out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2819700">It's true with programs, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2821185">If you can see how they work by looking through a soda</span> <span m="2823360">straw, you're in much better situation to understand</span> <span m="2826450">something if you have to look here and there and on the next</span> <span m="2828770">page and in the next file.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2831560">So all this is basically common sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2835510">But this is kind of common sense that makes you smarter</span> <span m="2838560">as an engineer and scientist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2840200">Especially as a scientist because if you go into a</span> <span m="2843080">problem with mechanism envy, you're apt to study mechanisms</span> <span m="2847850">in a naive way and never reach a solution that will be</span> <span m="2852280">satisfactory.</span> </p>

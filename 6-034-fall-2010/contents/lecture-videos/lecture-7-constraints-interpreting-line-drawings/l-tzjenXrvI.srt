00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,660
PATRICK WINSTON: Many of you,
maybe most of you, will never

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,850
have to work another search
problem by hand in your

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,510
natural life.

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,870
Others will want to
take another run

5
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,100
at it on the final.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,030
I've been much criticized
for this way of doing

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,000
grading in the class.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,490
But the way I look at it is that
the relationship between

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,330
students and instructors ought
to be less adversarial than it

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,910
used to be in the good old days
when I was a student.

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,100
I especially remember an
examination we took--

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,450
all of us took-- on Rayleigh
scattering.

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,670
That was 803, I think.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,720
And back in the old days, we
had to take four physics

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,640
courses, not just two.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,100
And we had to take four math
courses, not just two.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,830
Back in the days when--

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,450
well, I was going to
say men were men.

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,130
But most of us were
men in those days.

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,110
I think we only had 20
women in our class.

21
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,950
Anyway, we had a quiz on
Rayleigh scattering.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,910
And I thought, well, this
is pretty hard.

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,789
And then I got my quiz back.

24
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,370
26.

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,730
I thought, well, I've
been found out.

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,030
I'm going to flunk out.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,350
My father will make me
go to law school.

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,810
I'll never attract
anyone to marry.

29
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,479
Horrible things will happen.

30
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,884
Then the instructor announced
the class average was 18.

31
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:39,220
I was two standard deviations
above that.

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,420
They gave us the same exam
two weeks later,

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,030
and accounts vary.

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,340
Some people say that the class
average went down.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,720
Anyway, today we're going
to study some stuff.

36
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,780
We're going to study some
stuff that will make it

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,230
possible for you to understand
how you can do that

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,990
computation in just a couple
of seconds, even with the

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,610
delays introduced by
the redrawing.

40
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,660
Now this particular program--

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,970
I'm not real sure and I don't
have a proof, but I think it

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,530
will take more than the lifetime
of the universe to

43
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,910
find a legitimate coloring of
the continental United States.

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,860
But by the end of the next
class, you'll see how to do

45
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,820
that lickety-split in just
couple of seconds, even with

46
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,579
the re-display delays.

47
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Now we could, of course,
do this in two ways.

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,950
One way is I could start off
by saying, let C be a

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,490
constraint satisfaction
problem and just

50
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,170
give you the result.

51
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,950
And anybody can do that.

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,406
That's great.

53
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:53,030
And you needed to learn
some stuff that way.

54
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,740
But there are some things that
you needed to learn, I think,

55
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,630
a different way.

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,100
And that different way involves
my telling you the

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,750
story of how it all
came to be.

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,440
This is a new field, pretty
much, and therefore I know

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,730
most of the people in it.

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,730
And I know all of the people
who did the work that I'm

61
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,720
going to tell you about today.

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the struggle for

63
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:23,160
coming up with the ideas that
led to one of the most

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,130
powerful methods you'll learn
about in the subject.

65
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,670
It all has to do, originally,
with an attempt to make a

66
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,832
computer capable of seeing.

67
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:33,890
And everybody said to
themselves, well, let's start

68
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,280
with seeing simple things,
like children's blocks.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,040
And so Adolfo Guzman, a graduate
student of Marvin

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,480
Minsky's, was charged with the
summer project, which led to

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,590
his Ph.D. thesis, of writing a
program that could look at a

72
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,440
line drawing and determine
how many objects

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,730
are in the line drawing.

74
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,870
So for example, there behind my
outline is a line drawing.

75
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,400
And you believe instantly that
there are two objects there,

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,690
even though in some deep
sense, it's ambiguous.

77
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,540
There are all sorts of ways
that you could, through

78
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,579
trickery, arrange something with
even seven objects that

79
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,709
look that way.

80
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,269
But most people would say
there are two objects.

81
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,350
So Guzman set about the
problem of figuring

82
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,650
out how to do that.

83
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,860
And then his work was followed
by Dave Huffman.

84
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,440
And his work was followed
up by Dave Waltz.

85
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,850
And his work was followed up by
Jane [? Froyter ?], who's

86
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,880
not listed there quite yet.

87
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,580
And I want to tell you a little
bit of story how that

88
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,510
all happened.

89
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,440
So Guzman took a lot
of pictures.

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,870
He went to Boston Baby, the
precursor to Toys R Us,

91
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,990
purchased a large block set on
a government contract, and

92
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,640
went about the business of
taking a lot of pictures of

93
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,390
them so he'd get a feel
for the domain.

94
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,370
And eventually he decided that
he could build a program that

95
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,910
could determine that there are
two objects here by using the

96
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,800
lines as a quanta of evidence
about which faces belong

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,090
together in an object.

98
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,870
So he said, after studying these
for a long time, that

99
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,060
these drawings tend to have a
lot of arrow-type junctions

100
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,460
and a lot of fork-type
junctions.

101
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,980
And when you see an arrow, it's
a little bit of evidence

102
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,490
that the objects on either
side of the shaft are the

103
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,010
same-- the face on either side
of the shaft belong to the

104
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,880
same object.

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,590
And over here, the fork-type
junction suggests that

106
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,590
pairwise, three pairs
of faces seem to

107
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,909
belong to the same object.

108
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,659
So with that idea, he could come
back to a drawing like

109
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,570
this and start decorating it
with these so-called links,

110
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,090
these quanta of evidence
that faces

111
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,340
belong to the same object.

112
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,200
And if I've done it right,
you get something

113
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,230
that looks like so.

114
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,650
It's a little hard to
see what's going on

115
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,920
on the drawing itself.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,170
So let me number these.

117
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,180
Now I have an
easier-to-deal-with picture.

118
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,080
There are two links between
1 and 2 and 1 and 3.

119
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,890
One link between 2 and 3.

120
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,820
One between 2 and 4.

121
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,470
Two here.

122
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,120
Two here.

123
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,700
And one each from
all of these.

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,760
So Guzman produces this evidence
for how the problem

125
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,960
ought to be solved and then he
begins to think about various

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,050
ways of using the evidence.

127
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,830
So he could, and did, decide
that one link is enough to

128
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,720
presume that the faces belong
to the same object.

129
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,730
And you can see that that's
a little bit too liberal.

130
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,840
Because that says
that the whole

131
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,710
thing is just one object.

132
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,695
So Guzman rejected the one-link
theory and went to

133
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,945
the two-link theory.

134
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,110
And the two-link theory says,
oh, well, let's see.

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,390
If we insist that two links
should be there before we are

136
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,909
willing to decide that it's the
same object, then these

137
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,090
three faces are pulled together
into one object.

138
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,790
These three are pulled together
into one object.

139
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,409
But alas, 7 doesn't share two
links with anything, so it's

140
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,830
left dangling out there.

141
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,990
So plainly, the two-link theory
is too conservative.

142
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,110
So that as you would soon
discover in any [INAUDIBLE]

143
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,030
project, would lead you to a
third theory, which is two

144
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,960
lengths repeated.

145
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,430
So now that we've formed these
super regions, we can come

146
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,270
back and say we'll merge super
regions if they're connected

147
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,130
together by two or more links.

148
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,240
So nothing new happens
up here.

149
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
But this super region
is joined at 7

150
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
by two or more links.

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,270
So it pulls everything
together like so.

152
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,480
So that worked fine.

153
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Well, it didn't work fine.

154
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,620
There were lots of examples
of situations

155
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,850
where it didn't work--

156
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,230
in situations that were
considered nonsensical by us

157
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,620
humans because it seemed silly,
the kind of conclusions

158
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,770
that it reached.

159
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,870
So when Guzman presented this
work in his Ph.D. thesis

160
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,830
defense, it's said--

161
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,770
and who knows if it's true--
but it's said that Marvin

162
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,630
Minsky thought it was
great work and we

163
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,250
should make him a professor.

164
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,070
It happens that Dave Huffman was
also on the committee and

165
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,440
said that it was ad hoc and the
thesis should be rejected.

166
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,580
So we had two polar opposites
of impressions there.

167
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,920
Dave Huffman, by the way--

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,160
you've heard that name
before, I imagine.

169
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,830
It's the guy who invented
Huffman coating as a term

170
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,720
paper in a information theory
course taught by Bob Fano.

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,970
He got an A, they say.

172
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,840
So Huffman didn't like it.

173
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,860
He thought it was a little
bit too ad hoc.

174
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,430
It was too heuristic.

175
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,365
It didn't take advantage
of anything we

176
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,120
might know about physics.

177
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,500
And so people began to say,
well, why does it work?

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,570
And when does it not work?

179
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,130
And that's just about the best
question you can answer in a

180
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,832
situation like this.

181
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:48,300
And by playing with some more
of Guzman's pictures and

182
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,870
reflecting on them, it turned
out that it worked because the

183
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,670
world is full of three-face
junctions.

184
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,180
Or let me say three-face
vertexes because they're out

185
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,940
there in the world.

186
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,950
We'll reserve the word junction
for something else.

187
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:12,540
And three-face vertexes
generally project into either

188
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,430
an arrow or a fork.

189
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,410
So Guzman's whole program worked
on the weak backward

190
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,700
conclusion that if you see one
of those, it probably came

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,890
from one of these.

192
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,320
So this is in the drawing.

193
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,160
That's in the world.

194
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,130
So by a process that's neither
deduction or induction, but

195
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,410
rather abduction, you see
one of those guys.

196
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,840
And you say, well, they often
come from three-face vertexes

197
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,610
in the world, so if you see one,
it probably came from a

198
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,670
three-face vertex
in the world.

199
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,520
That's abduction.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,670
So once Huffman saw all that,
being a mathematician, he

201
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,135
began to think about how one
might develop a different and

202
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,430
better theory.

203
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:02,510
But we have to recognize that
all this work started off with

204
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,496
the efforts of Guzman, who
was an experimentalist.

205
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,775
And Huffman was a
mathematician.

206
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,520
So naturally, they approached
the problem differently.

207
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,140
So Huffman says, I'm not going
to concern myself too much

208
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,600
with the actual problem that
Guzman was trying to solve.

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,750
Rather, I'm going to work in a
very simple world, which I can

210
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,390
deal with mathematically.

211
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,560
So he decided that he was going
to work in a world which

212
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,490
had several characteristics.

213
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,760
Characteristic number one was
that the world would be

214
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,550
presented in general position.

215
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:02,190
That is to say, no
screw cases.

216
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,920
So if you see a cube, it's
going to look like this.

217
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,540
And it's not going to
look like this.

218
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,970
So that's out.

219
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,360
And this is in.

220
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,550
And the idea here is that that's
not general position,

221
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,930
because if you perturb your
point of view a little bit,

222
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,340
you'll change those T junctions

223
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,810
into forks and arrows.

224
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,430
So we know it had to deal
with those kinds of

225
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,210
weird kinds of cases.

226
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,820
So that's presumption
number one.

227
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,760
Presumption number two is that
we're going to be dealing with

228
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,010
a world that's trihedral.

229
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,080
That means all vertexes out
there are going to be formed

230
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,330
from three planes.

231
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,720
So you're going to have the
intersection of three planes.

232
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,840
So how many kinds of junctions
can you see if the world is

233
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,040
composed that way is the
question that Huffman sent

234
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,225
himself upon.

235
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:10,990
The next assumption was that
there are going to be four

236
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,840
kinds of lines.

237
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,820
See, Guzman only recognized
two kinds of lines-- lines

238
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,350
that have a length and lines
that don't have a link.

239
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,160
And they don't have very much to
do with the physical world.

240
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,060
So Huffman says, I want to get
the constraint out of the

241
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,610
physical world.

242
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,590
So I'm going to deal with
four kinds of lines--

243
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:34,660
concave, convex, and boundary.

244
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,030
So each of those kinds
of lines is going to

245
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,240
have its own notation.

246
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,080
We'll call the convex lines
plus, the concave lines minus,

247
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,600
and a boundary lines are going
to get an arrow on them,

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,330
depending on which side
of the object--

249
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,510
which side you would see the
object if you walk along the

250
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,364
direction of this
little arrow.

251
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:06,614
STUDENT: Question.

252
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,684
Which is concave and
which is convex?

253
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,636
You said something and you
wrote the opposite.

254
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:15,612
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, sorry.

255
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:18,060
Thank you.

256
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,480
So concave, convex,
and boundary.

257
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,270
Thank you.

258
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,345
So this down here, that's
a concave line.

259
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:26,550
And that would get
a minus label.

260
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,190
Oh, I don't know.

261
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,290
These lines you're seeing here,
if there were stuff

262
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,440
behind them instead of
me, then all those

263
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,960
would be convex lines.

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,220
Many times you see
a boundary line.

265
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,720
For example, now you don't see
both sides of that line down

266
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,370
here at the bottom.

267
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,750
So that's a boundary line.

268
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,250
And the arrow would point in
that direction, so as to keep

269
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,330
the stuff of the object on the
right as you walk along a kind

270
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,160
of mathematical convention.

271
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,710
So three kinds of lines,
four kinds of labels.

272
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,620
And there's some things
left out.

273
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,860
That's because Huffman wanted
to keep his problem simple,

274
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,690
something he could
manage by hand.

275
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,780
What's left out?

276
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,060
Cracks are left out.

277
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,160
Shadows are left out.

278
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,750
There's a presumption that
there's nothing of interest

279
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,000
here with respect to that.

280
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,260
So let's have a little
vocabulary before I go on.

281
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,560
And I'll try to stick to it.

282
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,100
But there's the stuff out there,
and that consists of

283
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,540
vertexes and edges.

284
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,700
And over here, on the
blackboard, we'll have

285
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,950
junctions and lines.

286
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,490
And I'll try to stick
to that vocabulary.

287
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:44,870
All right?

288
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,660
Yes, Christopher?

289
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,590
STUDENT: Didn't you say there
were four types of lines?

290
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,630
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, there
are four kinds of--

291
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,940
the question is, didn't
I say there were

292
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,840
four kinds of lines?

293
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,860
There are three kinds of lines,
but since we can label

294
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,100
a boundary line in
either direction,

295
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,980
we have four labels.

296
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,010
OK?

297
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,210
It depends on which side of the
object the stuff is on.

298
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,765
And that will be clear,
I think, as

299
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,670
soon as I do an example.

300
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,650
So one, two, three
assumptions.

301
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,170
A little bit of vocabulary.

302
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,280
So we have the possibility of
making a complete catalog.

303
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,220
This is so simple.

304
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,200
We have the possibility of
making a complete catalog of

305
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,510
all the ways that lines can
come together to form a

306
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,576
junction with respect to
these four labels.

307
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:31,730
Now at first you might say, oh
my god, that will take a

308
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,230
couple of years.

309
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,380
But maybe it won't take
a couple of years.

310
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:43,320
And in the end, to perhaps your
surprise, you discover

311
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,660
that there are only 18 ways to
arrange the labels around a

312
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,760
junction in this world.

313
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,220
Everything else is excluded.

314
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,040
If you have something that's not
in the set we're going to

315
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,930
produce now, it can't be built
with trihedral vertexes.

316
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:10,400
So I've listed up there six L's,
five forks, four T's, and

317
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,650
three arrows.

318
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,319
Let's see if I can figure out
why there are those 18 and

319
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,569
nothing else.

320
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,300
Well, if we have three vertexes
coming together, that

321
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,010
means there are eight
octants, right?

322
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,840
And the stuff of the object may
fill 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

323
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,030
or all eight octants.

324
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,450
Now of course, if you
fill all eight

325
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,330
octants, there's no junction.

326
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,250
So we don't consider
that case.

327
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,080
If we don't fill any the
octants, there's no junction.

328
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,890
There's no vertex.

329
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,540
So we don't consider
that case.

330
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,080
But if just one of the eight
octants is filled with stuff,

331
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,130
then we can look at
it from any of the

332
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,760
seven remaining octants.

333
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,360
So right now, you're looking
at it from one of the seven

334
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,880
remaining octants.

335
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,750
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're going to see a

336
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,800
fork-style junction
there, right?

337
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
And you're going to see a
fork-style junction in which

338
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,905
all of the edges are convex.

339
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,850
An unfortunate selection of
names, because the linguists

340
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,600
tell me that we index
all of our words

341
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,500
by the first forename.

342
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,210
And those have the same
first forename, so

343
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,840
they're easily confused.

344
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,830
So here's a fork-style
junction.

345
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,160
And we know that one way that's
legitimate for the

346
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,050
lines to come in is
with four pluses.

347
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,120
Now that's not the only
way you can see that.

348
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,170
And here's another way.

349
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,200
There's an L-style
junction, right?

350
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,650
And both of those are
boundary lines.

351
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,810
And we want to draw the boundary
line indicators on

352
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,550
there so that if we walk along
the arrows, the stuff of the

353
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,180
object would be on the right.

354
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,730
So I suppose, to make it easier
to me do my drawing, I

355
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,520
should look at it this way.

356
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,650
And then I would say, well, that
has to be a legitimate

357
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,350
way of labeling a junction.

358
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,160
Are there any more?

359
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,230
Well, there's seven altogether,
but many of them

360
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,760
are the same.

361
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,010
There is one more that's a
little different, though.

362
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,470
I can hold this guy
up like so.

363
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,070
And if I'm holding at the right
angle for you, you see

364
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,020
an arrow-style junction,
right?

365
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,275
Two boundaries, and the
barb is convex.

366
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,143
So in this particular
case, I've got that.

367
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:28,365
I've got that.

368
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:31,840
And I've got a plus there.

369
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,350
And that's there happen to be
for the one octant filled with

370
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,100
stuff case.

371
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,890
I happen to be able to
reverse this, though.

372
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,200
And here's the seven octants
filled case.

373
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,940
So that tells us that it's
possible to have a vertex out

374
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,340
there in a space that when
reduced to a junction on the

375
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,760
board deserves three minus
labels, because all of these

376
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,680
that you're seeing
now are concave.

377
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,920
So another fork-style junction
looks like so.

378
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,210
And since there's only one
octant to look at from, that

379
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,280
completes our analysis of the
seven octants filled case.

380
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,360
Now we have a couple of other
possibilities here.

381
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,440
We might have five octants
filled with stuff.

382
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,420
So that means there are three
octants that we can look from.

383
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,030
So let's suppose that
these little chalk

384
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,860
pieces are little people.

385
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,580
And they're looking at this
junction down there, where

386
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,930
this white object is fused
with the table.

387
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm fusing it with the table
because I want to consider it

388
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,100
to be one object.

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,280
We can view it from the three
objects indicated by those

390
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,190
three little chalk pieces.

391
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,580
And ask ourselves, well, in the
event that we look at it

392
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,110
from those three places,
what do we see?

393
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,000
And if we look at it from the
perspective of the piece of

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,780
purple chalk--

395
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,610
I'll have to walk around
and be sure--

396
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,960
looks like an arrow
junction with two

397
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,575
concaves and a convex.

398
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,270
Did I get that right?

399
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,080
So I'm looking at it from
this perspective.

400
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,210
It's an arrow.

401
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,460
This is convex and these two
are concave because I fused

402
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,350
the paper box with the table.

403
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,840
Looking at it from the
perspective of this blue guy--

404
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,580
let me rotate it so you can have
a better understanding of

405
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,610
the blue guy--

406
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,250
it looks like a concave
line and a boundary.

407
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,750
So it's an L. And this
one is a boundary.

408
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,400
And that's concave.

409
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,710
And by a kind of symmetry, we're
also going to get that

410
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,250
one from the other side, the
third of the three octants.

411
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,300
Well, we're off and running.

412
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,660
But we still have an
awful lot to go.

413
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,760
And we could manage to deal with
it by thinking about this

414
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,640
object once again.

415
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,290
But instead of this situation
out here, to turn it around

416
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,310
and look at this vertex.

417
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,580
Think about the junctions
that it can produce.

418
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,860
I think I'll do that for you.

419
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,610
Because you really have to play
with this and move it

420
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,000
around a little bit to see how
things are going to look.

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,480
So let me think about how that's
going to work out.

422
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,150
I know that one of the
possibilities is going

423
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,480
to look like so.

424
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,830
I might as well not hide
that from you.

425
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,080
It's going to be what happens
when there's a little man

426
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,770
looking up at the junction.

427
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,720
And this one's going
to be minus.

428
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,954
And now we've got two more
that are just like that.

429
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:45,204
Look like so.

430
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,270
And you say, oops.

431
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,230
You say, aren't those
just a rotational

432
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,780
variance of each other?

433
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,530
And the answer is sure.

434
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,280
I write them all down, because
if you get a fork-style

435
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,870
junction in space, there are
three different ways it could

436
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,300
be labeled.

437
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,640
Depending on which of
the lines you put

438
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
the minus label on.

439
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
So that takes care of that.

440
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,310
And then there's one more of
these fork-style junctions.

441
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:36,200
And that's plus, plus, minus
that derives from this case.

442
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,150
And there appear to
be three more of

443
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,120
these L-style junctions.

444
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:50,280
And they look like, let's
see, plus, then plus.

445
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,860
I'm having to think this
through as I go.

446
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,110
And then--

447
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,490
and that's it.

448
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,980
Well, what about the T's?

449
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,420
Well, in this world, the only
way you can get a T is if some

450
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,605
object is obscuring
another object.

451
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:10,050
And if an object is obscuring
a line, it can

452
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,130
be any line at all.

453
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,980
So that's why the four remaining
ones are easy beyond

454
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,470
description to label.

455
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,820
And of course, the cross
pieces of the T are all

456
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,930
boundary lines, with the
obscuring object on the right.

457
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,520
Now let's see.

458
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,110
We've taken care now of the one,
three, five, and seven

459
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,480
octants filled cases.

460
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,060
What about two, four, and six?

461
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,480
Well, it turns out you can have
vertexes that are made

462
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,930
that way too.

463
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,180
But they will have more
than three faces.

464
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,730
They'll have six faces.

465
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:57,255
They'll be like what happens
when an object comes together

466
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,505
at a point, like so.

467
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:02,760
Like that.

468
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,500
You can play with it a little
bit and see that if you have

469
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,090
two, four, or six objects filled
with stuff, there are

470
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,010
more than three faces.

471
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,690
So we're going to
ignore those.

472
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,040
So our constraint is going to
be a little more severe than

473
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,640
would be suggested by the
terminology Huffman uses.

474
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,850
They're going to be trihedral
all right, but they're also

475
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,100
going to be three faces.

476
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,830
So we went to a lot
of work there.

477
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,670
But what have we discovered?

478
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,120
We've discovered that in this
world, this is a complete,

479
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,970
100% percent, nothing excluded,
nothing else can be

480
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,680
there, catalog of all possible
ways the junctions can have

481
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,770
line labels arranged
around them.

482
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,010
There's nothing else
in this world.

483
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,970
So that's a very powerful
constraint.

484
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,620
So now let's see what
we can do with it.

485
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,340
This example is usually more fun
when the Red Sox are doing

486
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,340
better, but they're not.

487
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,870
Yet we'll use it any way.

488
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,870
We're going to start
with an object that

489
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,120
looks like home plate.

490
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,900
And I'll ask you the question.

491
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,210
Can you build one of those?

492
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,940
I don't know.

493
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,640
Let's give it a shot.

494
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,790
We're going to assume that
this object is hanging,

495
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,250
floating in space.

496
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,130
So therefore, all of these lines
around the boundary are

497
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,490
boundary lines, like so.

498
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,140
Now that gets us off to a good--
it's just hanging in

499
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,040
space, Christopher, all right?

500
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,570
You look confused.

501
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,230
It's just hanging in space so
that all the lines around the

502
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:45,770
edges are places where you see
only one side has stuff on it.

503
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,650
So that enables us to just
quickly run around the

504
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,210
periphery and put arrow labels
on all those outside lines.

505
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,690
Now we have a lot
of arrow-style

506
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,020
junctions on the boundary.

507
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,340
That's commonly the case.

508
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,900
So we can run over to our
catalog of all possible

509
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,410
labels, and we see that if we
have an arrow with boundaries

510
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,490
on its barbs, there's
only one of those.

511
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,790
So I know instantly that there
must be a plus on the shaft.

512
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,070
So we can come back here and
take all these arrows here.

513
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,310
And label them with plus
lines on their shafts.

514
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:25,810
Now a line can't change its
nature along its length.

515
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,390
So if it's a plus line on one
end, it's going to be a plus

516
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,705
line on the other end.

517
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:32,970
All right?

518
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,220
So what else can we do?

519
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,840
Here deep inside is a
fork-style junction.

520
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,840
It's got convex markers on
both of those two lines.

521
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,130
So we go over to our catalog and
say, what can we say about

522
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,660
it, given that there are pluses
on two of its lines?

523
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,230
Whoop, that means that
the third one has to

524
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,480
be a plus as well.

525
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,390
And now we're done.

526
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,370
We've labeled everything.

527
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,830
Except--

528
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,540
look at this.

529
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,930
What about that guy?

530
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,140
There's an L-style junction
with pluses on

531
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,240
both of its two lines.

532
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,020
Is there one of those
in my catalog?

533
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,280
No.

534
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,180
Therefore, I haven't passed
a necessary condition for

535
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,020
constructability in the
world that I've made.

536
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,080
You can't make it.

537
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,330
You can't construct it.

538
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:30,470
So Huffman's ideas give us a
way of testing something to

539
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,600
see if it's not possible for
it to be in this world.

540
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,200
If it passes the test, does
that mean it's possible?

541
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,740
No.

542
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,740
It's a necessary but not
sufficient condition.

543
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,730
On this one--

544
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,580
blue-collar occupation--

545
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,910
on this one, maybe it
will help if we

546
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,060
put in another line.

547
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,100
For example, we could
put a line like so.

548
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,760
You feel better about it now?

549
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,530
I don't know.

550
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,290
Let's see.

551
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:09,390
This has to be a plus for the
same argument we used on

552
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,200
several other arrows before.

553
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,120
That gives us an arrow-style
junction here with a plus on

554
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,140
everything.

555
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,298
Is there such a junction
label?

556
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:21,510
No.

557
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,445
We lose.

558
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:23,670
It doesn't help.

559
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,632
You think you can make
it, but you can't.

560
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,272
STUDENT: You could actually
construct it as

561
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:30,584
a 3-D object, though.

562
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,900
PATRICK WINSTON: He
thinks you can

563
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,570
construct it as a 3-D object.

564
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,790
Let me show you the next
example, Christopher.

565
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,040
Consider this example.

566
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,570
Can you make that?

567
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,300
Your intuition is yes.

568
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,550
So let's label it.

569
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:12,480
Oh, I've already lost.

570
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,890
We just boost that up a
little bit to make the

571
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,140
situation more clear.

572
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,670
So already, I've got myself in
a situation where I can't

573
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,230
label that.

574
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,090
But you feel like
you can make it.

575
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,290
So what's wrong?

576
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,560
What's wrong is--

577
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,220
what, Elliott?

578
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,350
STUDENT: You have
an obscured--

579
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,126
or, we're presuming that we have
an obscured [INAUDIBLE]

580
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:51,400
alley from the upper-left corner
to the [INAUDIBLE].

581
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,490
PATRICK WINSTON: Putting a
little interpretation on what

582
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,660
Elliott has said.

583
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,410
If you look at this situation
back here, you get a

584
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,600
four-faced junction there.

585
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,700
So you can make it.

586
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,000
But not with three faces.

587
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,030
So some of these look like
you could make it.

588
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,900
But they can't be labeled
because you need more than

589
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,300
four faces at a junction.

590
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,650
And we can carry that
idea back here.

591
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,780
You can make this OK.

592
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,810
But this junction, you've got
two in the back and two here.

593
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,970
So it has four faces.

594
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,720
Same idea.

595
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:37,970
So that's Guzman's
contribution.

596
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,080
That's Huffman's contribution.

597
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,900
Huffman was a mathematician.

598
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
But we wanted to build robots
back in those days.

599
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,790
And neither one of these guys
solved the problem of dealing

600
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:51,530
with natural objects with
shadows, with cracks, with

601
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,710
more than trihedral vertexes
in space, and

602
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,585
what to do about that?

603
00:31:57,585 --> 00:32:02,110
Well, that was a problem that
another graduate student,

604
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,840
David Waltz, set
about to solve.

605
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:15,310
So Waltz decided that he would
not be content unless he added

606
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:25,170
cracks, shadows, non-trihedral
vertexes.

607
00:32:29,123 --> 00:32:30,560
Uh--

608
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,810
yeah, non-trihedral vertexes.

609
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,580
And light.

610
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,630
These considerations led
Waltz to go from

611
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,450
four labels to 50-plus.

612
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,810
Because he had to pack a lot
of information into each of

613
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,760
the labels he put on a line.

614
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,110
What kind of light
was on the right?

615
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,310
What kind of light
was on the left?

616
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,140
Maybe it's a crack.

617
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,630
Maybe it's a crack that--

618
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,850
all sorts of considerations.

619
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,360
Here we had 18 ways that
lines can come

620
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,610
together around junctions.

621
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,130
That went to thousands of
junctions in Waltz's world.

622
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,380
So here's Guzman.

623
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,410
He writes a program that
sort of works.

624
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Down below, we have Huffman.

625
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:48,090
Huffman, who has a theory but
solves the wrong problem.

626
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,500
So here comes Waltz, and he's
trying to solve the right

627
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,810
problem with a satisfying
theory that has a

628
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,720
generalizable principle.

629
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,710
So when we get all through
this, we'll talk about

630
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,960
criteria for success.

631
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,060
And we'll conclude that to
have a really successful

632
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,670
thing, you need a problem,
to start with.

633
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,790
You need a method that works.

634
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,850
And you have to show
that it works

635
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,040
because of some principal.

636
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,040
So Guzman had the problem and
something that worked.

637
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,219
Huffman had a method which
worked on the wrong problem.

638
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,790
And it's left to Waltz to
bring it all together.

639
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,770
So Waltz does all this work.

640
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,530
And now he has, instead at 18
labels, he has thousands.

641
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,469
Instead of four-line labels,
he has more than 50.

642
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,280
So naturally, it becomes
difficult to

643
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,659
work these by hand.

644
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:42,639
We were able to work those
Huffman examples by hand.

645
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,018
We started with labeling
everything on the boundary and

646
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:45,580
worked our way in.

647
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,960
There's no particular
method there.

648
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,650
It was just easy to work
out the puzzle.

649
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,500
But poor Waltz, he didn't
have that luxury.

650
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,910
So he might have, in a typical
scene, he might have tens or

651
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:04,130
even hundreds of junctions to
label and no easy way of

652
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,930
dealing with it.

653
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,060
So naturally writes himself a
depth-first search program.

654
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:19,420
So here is vertex, or rather
junction number 1.

655
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,080
There are many choices for which
label can be used on it.

656
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,070
And for each of those choices,
whatever he's decided junction

657
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:34,090
number 2 is has its own suite
of possibilities.

658
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,670
And so it becomes a
simple depth-first

659
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,040
search problem, right?

660
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,580
So in actuality, as
soon as Waltz--

661
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,940
he was my office mate
at the time.

662
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,960
I can tell you this
for a fact.

663
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,080
As soon as he wrote this
program, he kept looking over

664
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,900
at the computer--

665
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,290
they were big in those days.

666
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,540
They all had lights.

667
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,270
So you looked over at the
computer to see if the lights

668
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,860
were still blinking.

669
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,290
Because he'd start this
depth-first search program up

670
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,080
and nothing would happen.

671
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,820
He thought the computer
had crashed.

672
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,520
Nothing happened.

673
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,550
Why did nothing happen?

674
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,350
Because the search base is
exponential and much too big

675
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,570
for an ordinary computer,
or maybe

676
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,970
even an ordinary universe.

677
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,490
So Waltz has to do
something else.

678
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,130
He has to come up with a new
method for using all these

679
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,080
labels that he's--

680
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,410
after about a year and a half's
worth of hard work,

681
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,990
with lots of paper on his
desk in little blocks.

682
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,230
After year and a half of hard
work getting all these

683
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,560
junction labels figured out, he
then has to come up with a

684
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,850
method for figuring out
how to use them.

685
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,210
And so we don't know whether
to think his biggest

686
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,390
contribution was that label
set or his method.

687
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,328
And probably both deserve
about equal billing.

688
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:54,710
Oh, I don't know how to explain
what Waltz did.

689
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,470
Well, one way is to
do an example.

690
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,875
And I think I will hazard
an example.

691
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,000
Let's see.

692
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,165
Let me find some space.

693
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:15,000
I think I'm reduced to
going over here.

694
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,835
But that will be convenient,
since the

695
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,085
line labels are here.

696
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,630
Here's my example.

697
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:39,650
And you say, how can I give you
just part of a picture?

698
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:42,140
Well, you can assume
I'm looking at

699
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,690
this through a window.

700
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,290
So the edge of the window form
boundary lines, and they exert

701
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,350
no constraint whatsoever
on what's behind them.

702
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,760
So this is a legitimate
drawing to

703
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,470
have to think about.

704
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,950
By the way, is this ambiguous?

705
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,630
Or do you get a firm sense
that there's a unique

706
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,650
interpretation of
all those lines?

707
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,760
I think there's a unique
interpretation

708
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,640
of all those lines.

709
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,130
What I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to solve this

710
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,510
problem using Huffman's labels
but Waltz's method.

711
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,900
Because I can't simulate on the
blackboard something with

712
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,650
50 line types and thousands
of line junctions.

713
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,950
So I'm going to use
Huffman's set to

714
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,390
demonstrate Waltz's algorithm.

715
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:32,040
So Waltz's algorithm involves
starting out by plopping on

716
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,080
some junction all of the
possible labels that the

717
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,120
answer has to be drawn from.

718
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,670
So let me number these in the
order that we're going to

719
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,876
visit them.

720
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,070
Like so.

721
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:53,080
And so far, I've just put down
the three fork options that

722
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,010
are resident on that
first junction.

723
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,650
And I have to take note of
exactly what they do with the

724
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,660
lines that come out
of the junction.

725
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,160
So let's see.

726
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,920
I'll just copy them down.

727
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,760
One possibility is this one.

728
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,350
Another possibility
is this one.

729
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:17,590
And another possibility
is plus, plus, minus.

730
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,840
Oops, I've got plus, plus.

731
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,020
No, that's right.

732
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,410
So that right so far?

733
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,840
All I've done is copy
the junction

734
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,045
labelings from my library.

735
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:31,760
And at this point, Waltz's
algorithm says there's nothing

736
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,810
else to do but go on to
junction number two.

737
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:40,630
And unfortunately, sadly, there
are lots of labelings

738
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,260
that have to be considered
on junction number 2.

739
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,170
Six of them.

740
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

741
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,090
So one of them looks
like that.

742
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,250
Another one looks like that.

743
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,180
One of them is plus
here, arrow in.

744
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:06,890
Another one is plus
here, arrow out.

745
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:14,130
Another one is minus
here, arrow down.

746
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,020
And minus here, arrow up.

747
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,615
I think I've copied
those all right.

748
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:23,950
But now, having copied those
down, Waltz's algorithm looks

749
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,760
around at the neighboring
junctions and says, are any of

750
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,130
the things that I just placed on
junction two disallowed by

751
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,250
what I've already placed on
a neighboring junction?

752
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:42,100
So it looks over here
in step number two.

753
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,050
And it sees that these three
arrows require the line that

754
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,540
joins junctions 1 and 2 to
be either minus or plus.

755
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,690
So of the six possibilities, I
can only keep the ones that

756
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,730
are likewise content to put
a plus on that line

757
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,160
that joins the two.

758
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,760
So that means that the influence
flowing from

759
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,870
junction 1 eliminates that
one, eliminates that one,

760
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,590
eliminates that one, and
eliminates that one.

761
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,670
So half of them are gone.

762
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,540
All the ones that try to put a
boundary line on that line

763
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,335
between 1 and 2 are
disallowed.

764
00:41:34,335 --> 00:41:36,740
All right?

765
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,730
Now likewise, we could say,
well, of the remaining ones,

766
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,550
do they restrict what I
can do at junction 1?

767
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,050
So let's see.

768
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,520
Here's a minus.

769
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,680
And here's a plus.

770
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:54,300
So all these possibilities over
here are still alive.

771
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,690
So now, continuing on, we have
to see what we can do at

772
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,550
junction 3.

773
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,360
These are arrow labels again.

774
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,030
So we have to copy exactly
the same labels

775
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,280
set as we had before.

776
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,810
And now we look down at junction
2 and say, well, what

777
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,920
does that tell me about the
three that I've just placed?

778
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,820
If we look up from junction
2 to see what kind of

779
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,000
constraints it puts on here,
we have this one alive and

780
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,710
this one alive.

781
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,040
I guess we've eliminated
four of the six.

782
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,010
So we have these two alive.

783
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,990
And they both but
boundary lines--

784
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,920
I think I must have had this
boundary line wrong, right?

785
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,170
No, that's right.

786
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,760
Oh yes, I see.

787
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,130
Plus.

788
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,920
This one goes--

789
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,655
hang on a second.

790
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,020
You let me do something wrong.

791
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,396
So plus is out.

792
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:03,770
And that must be
one that goes--

793
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,360
this minus goes up.

794
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,040
Oh, yes.

795
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,980
I'm too hasty and uncertain
about what I was doing.

796
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,570
So let's see.

797
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,660
This guy has a boundary
going down.

798
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,140
And this guy has a boundary
going up.

799
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,390
All of the others have
been eliminated.

800
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,780
So that means that something
that tries to put a concave

801
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,580
line there is gone.

802
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,340
And something that tries to put
a plus line there is gone.

803
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,490
So the influence flowing up in
this direction in the third

804
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,300
step eliminates that guy and
eliminates that guy, leaving

805
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,460
only this guy.

806
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,200
But now, the thing I was worried
about is you have to

807
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,810
also at this point go down to
2 and see if there's any

808
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:50,030
further constraint on what can
survive down there, based on

809
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,440
what has happened over
here at junction 3.

810
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,170
Now let's see.

811
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:58,190
This one goes up, which is
compatible with a survivor.

812
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,860
But this one goes down,
which is not

813
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,020
compatible with a survivor.

814
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:05,930
So when I bring this down in
step three, this guy is

815
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,470
eliminated.

816
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,590
So now I'm down to just one
interpretation for what can be

817
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,140
going on at vertex number 2.

818
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,290
And one interpretation
for vertex number 3.

819
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,190
Now let's see.

820
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,360
This can propagate.

821
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,840
So now that I've made a change
on vertex number 2, I have to

822
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,640
also see if that causes a change
at vertex number 1.

823
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,540
So it's propagating through.

824
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,030
And now I can see that the only
possibility here is a

825
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:39,730
minus, the label that's coming
down from our survivor.

826
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:42,730
So that eliminates these two.

827
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,620
Whew!

828
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,560
It's hard to do this by hand,
but I've got three of the four

829
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,530
things labeled.

830
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,940
And even with just three of the
four labeled, I'm down to

831
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,870
a single interpretation for all
of the junctions and the

832
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,120
lines between them.

833
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,370
So there's one left.

834
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,080
We have to deal with
that fork vertex.

835
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,240
We better deal with it, because
for all we know, this

836
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,140
is not a legal drawing
in this world.

837
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,180
We have five fork vertexes
to place.

838
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,370
But you know what?

839
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,860
I don't have to draw much here,
because I know this is

840
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,640
forced to be a plus now.

841
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,840
And this is forced
to be a plus now.

842
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,730
And there's only one fork
vertex with any

843
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,940
pluses on it at all.

844
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,800
So now I can come through and
say, well, the only possible

845
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,580
survivor is this one.

846
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,440
These are gone.

847
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,540
And now I have an
interpretation

848
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,850
for all of the junctions.

849
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:42,830
And I see that the winners
are this one.

850
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,310
And this one.

851
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,900
And this one.

852
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,240
And this one.

853
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,120
So I've got a unique
interpretation.

854
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,260
This line is convex.

855
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,620
This one is concave.

856
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,830
This is a boundary.

857
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,560
That's a boundary.

858
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,604
And this line is convex,
and that's convex.

859
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,655
Now that's a lot of work.

860
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:07,020
So I better check and make
sure I got it right.

861
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,840
You'd like to see this
demonstrated to make sure I

862
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
haven't made a mistake.

863
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,090
I'm sure of that.

864
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,545
Let's see.

865
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:19,795
That it?

866
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,940
So each of the places where a
line is obscured has four

867
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,190
possibilities, labeled E. The
arrow junctions are labeled A.

868
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,710
The forks-- there are five of
them-- at the fork junction 5.

869
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,890
So let's just step through here
and see what happens.

870
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,340
Boom.

871
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,320
I've got it.

872
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,570
I did do it right.

873
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,330
So let's try some more.

874
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,820
What do you think will
happen with this one?

875
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,070
Unique solution?

876
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,746
It stopped.

877
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:07,390
Bug in my program?

878
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,500
Unthinkable.

879
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,280
What's happened?

880
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,220
It is genuinely ambiguous.

881
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,790
It can be something hanging
down from the ceiling.

882
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,920
Or it could be something that
we can think of as a step

883
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,170
going up from left to right.

884
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,420
Let's look at something
more complicated.

885
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,490
You think it'll work?

886
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,960
Not enough constraint for us
to figure that one out.

887
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,530
It's equally ambiguous, but a
little bit larger example.

888
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:44,780
What about this one?

889
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,130
Yeah, but the stuff is creeping
up from the lower

890
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,710
left up to the upper right.

891
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,500
Yeah, bingo.

892
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,210
It worked.

893
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,800
It's unambiguous.

894
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,410
It's variation on the same
theme we had before.

895
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,980
But let me, just for fun, take
these two lines out.

896
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,510
What do you think
will happen now?

897
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,810
Seems to be doing just fine
until it hits the upper

898
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,560
right-hand corner and discovers

899
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,240
it can't label stuff.

900
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,530
So it propagates back down.

901
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,200
And what looked OK in
the lower left is

902
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,190
no good after all.

903
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:28,510
So these results are kind of
consistent with what we humans

904
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,510
do when we look at these
kinds of things.

905
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,120
So it's very likely that we,
in our heads, do have some

906
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,740
constraint propagation
apparatus

907
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,590
that we use in vision.

908
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,200
But putting that aside, we can
think about other kinds of

909
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,940
intelligence different from
human, that might use this

910
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,070
kind of mechanism to solve
problems that involve a lot of

911
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,480
constraint in finding
a solution.

912
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,780
So here, we saw the constraint
propagation activity at work

913
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,380
on line drawing analysis.

914
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,780
But next time, what we're going
do is we're going to see

915
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,910
at work in map coloring.

916
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,970
And who cares about
map coloring?

917
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,100
People who do scheduling,
because that turns out to be

918
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,350
the same problem.

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Can multiple weak classifiers be used to make a strong one?  We examine the boosting algorithm, which adjusts the weight of each classifier, and work through the math.

<p><span m="9640">PATRICK WINSTON: We've now almost completed our journey.</span> </p>
<p><span m="11900">This will be it for talking about</span> <span m="15650">several kinds of learning--</span> <span m="17260">the venerable kind, that's the nearest neighbors and</span> <span m="21920">identification tree types of learning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24310">Still useful, still the right thing to do if there's no</span> <span m="26910">reason not to do the simple thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="30180">Then we have the biologically-inspired</span> <span m="32330">approaches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="33290">Neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="35110">All kinds of problems with local maxima and overfitting</span> <span m="38500">and oscillation, if you get the rate constant too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="45600">Genetic algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="48870">Like neural nets, both are very naive in their attempt to</span> <span m="53150">mimic nature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="54800">So maybe they work on a class of problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="57250">They surely do each have a class of problems for which</span> <span m="59470">they're good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="59940">But as a general purpose first resort, I don't recommend it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="65190">But now the theorists have come out and done some things</span> <span m="67540">are very remarkable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69539">And in the end, you have to say, wow, these are such</span> <span m="71830">powerful ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="74490">I wonder if nature has discovered them, too?</span> </p>
<p><span m="77780">Is there good engineering in the brain,</span> <span m="80420">based on good science?</span> </p>
<p><span m="82780">Or given the nature of evolution, is it just random</span> <span m="84990">junk that is the best ways for doing anything?</span> </p>
<p><span m="88800">Who knows?</span> </p>
<p><span m="90180">But today, we're going to talk about an idea that I'll bet is</span> <span m="92220">in there somewhere, because it's easy to implement, and</span> <span m="96259">it's extremely powerful in what it does, and it's the</span> <span m="101180">essential item in anybody's repertoire of learning</span> <span m="104979">mechanisms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106860">It's also a mechanism which, if you understand only by</span> <span m="111820">formula, you will never be able to work the problems on</span> <span m="115789">the quiz, that's for sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="117759">Because on the surface, it looks like it'd be very</span> <span m="120780">complicated to simulate this approach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="123920">But once you understand how it works and look at a little bit</span> <span m="126530">of the math and let it sing songs to you, it turns out to</span> <span m="128919">be extremely easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="133270">So it's about letting multiple methods work in your behalf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="138980">So far, we've been talking about using just one method to</span> <span m="141490">do something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="143100">And what we're going to do now is we're looking to see if a</span> <span m="145780">crowd can be smarter than the individuals in the crowd.</span> </p>
<p><span m="153370">But before we get too far down that abstract path, let me</span> <span m="156430">just say that the whole works has to do with classification,</span> <span m="160750">and binary classification.</span> </p>
<p><span m="164110">Am I holding a piece of chalk in my hand, or a hand grenade?</span> </p>
<p><span m="168500">Is that a cup of coffee or tea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="170750">Those are binary classification problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="173740">And so we're going to be talking today strictly about</span> <span m="175790">binary classification.</span> </p>
<p><span m="177590">We're not going to be talking about finding the right letter</span> <span m="179570">in the alphabet that's written on the page.</span> </p>
<p><span m="182290">That's a 26-way choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="184450">We're talking about binary choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="187190">So we assume that there's a set of classifiers</span> <span m="190610">that we can draw on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="192280">Here's one--</span> <span m="193090">h.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194520">And it produces either a minus 1 or a plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="200050">So that's how the classification is done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="202880">If it's coffee, plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="204340">If it's tea, minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="206340">Is this chalk, plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="207650">If it's a hand grenade, minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="209400">So that's how the classification works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="212710">Now, too bad for us, normally the world doesn't give us very</span> <span m="216090">good classifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="216980">So if we look at the error rate of this classifier or any</span> <span m="222500">other classifier, that error rate will range from 0 to 1 in</span> <span m="230180">terms of the fraction of the cases got</span> <span m="234480">wrong on a sample set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="238230">So you'd like your error rate to be way down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="242020">You're dead if it's over there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="244250">But what about in the middle?</span> </p>
<p><span m="245950">What if it's, say, right there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="248420">Just a little bit better than flipping a coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="251690">If it's just a little bit better than flipping a coin,</span> <span m="254800">that's a weak classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="264660">And the question is, can you make a classifier that's way</span> <span m="268560">over here, like there, a strong classifier, by</span> <span m="279240">combining several of these weak classifiers, and</span> <span m="283210">letting them vote?</span> </p>
<p><span m="286090">So how would you do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="287340">You might say, well, let us make a big classifier capital</span> <span m="291920">H, that works on some sample x, and has its output produces</span> <span m="303190">something that depends on the sum of the outputs of the</span> <span m="305920">individual classifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="308180">So we have H1 working on x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="313100">We have H2 working on x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="318340">And we have H3 also working on x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="321770">Let's say three of them, just to start us off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="324710">And now let's add those guys up, and take</span> <span m="328670">the sign of the output.</span> </p>
<p><span m="336190">So if two out of the three of those guys agree, then we'll</span> <span m="340690">get an either plus 1 or minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="343409">If all three agree, we'll get plus 1 or minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="346150">Because we're just taking the sign.</span> </p>
<p><span m="348320">We're just taking the sign of the sum of these guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="352620">So this means that one guy can be wrong, as long as the other</span> <span m="356230">two guys are right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="358180">But I think it's easier to see how this all works if you</span> <span m="361850">think of some space of samples, you say, well, let's</span> <span m="367380">let that area here be where H1 is wrong, and this area over</span> <span m="375330">here is where H2 is wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="382360">And then this area over here is where H3 is wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="390430">So if the situation is like that, then this formula always</span> <span m="394710">gives you the right answers on the samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="398250">I'm going to stop saying that right now, because I want to</span> <span m="400610">be kind of a background thing on the samples set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="404370">We're talking about wrapping this stuff</span> <span m="405900">over the sample set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="407840">Later on, we'll ask, OK, given that you trained this thing on</span> <span m="410170">a sample set, how well does it do on some new examples?</span> </p>
<p><span m="412880">Because we want to ask ourselves</span> <span m="414420">about overfitting questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="417150">But for now, we just want to look and see if we believe</span> <span m="421760">that this arrangement, where each of these H's is producing</span> <span m="426690">plus 1 or minus 1, we're adding them up and taking the</span> <span m="429450">sign, is that going to give us a better result than the tests</span> <span m="432960">individually?</span> </p>
<p><span m="433540">And if they look like this when draped over a sample set,</span> <span m="437620">then it's clear that we're going to get the right answer</span> <span m="439330">every time, because there's no area here where any two of</span> <span m="444540">those tests are giving us the wrong answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="447640">So the two that are getting the right answer, in this</span> <span m="450740">little circle here for H1, these other two are getting</span> <span m="453530">the right answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="454190">So they'll outvote it, and you'll get the right answer</span> <span m="456420">every time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="459030">But it doesn't have to be that simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="464240">It could look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="470159">There could be a situation where this</span> <span m="474090">is H1, wrong answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="477080">This is H2, wrong answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="479600">And this is H3, wrong answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="484140">And now the situation gets a little bit more murky, because</span> <span m="488150">we have to ask ourselves whether that area where three</span> <span m="495820">out of the three get it wrong is sufficiently big so as to</span> <span m="504870">be worse than 1 of the individual tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="511490">So if you look at that Venn diagram, and stare at it long</span> <span m="514169">enough, and try some things, you can say, well, there is no</span> <span m="517260">case where this will give a worse answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="520530">Or, you might end up with the conclusion that there are</span> <span m="524590">cases where we can arrange those circles such that the</span> <span m="530080">voting scheme will give an answer that's worst than an</span> <span m="532220">individual test, but I'm not going to tell you the answer,</span> <span m="535260">because I think we'll make that a quiz question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="538970">Good idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="539830">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="540870">So we'll make that a quiz question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546700">So that looks like a good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="548840">And we can construct a little algorithm that will help us</span> <span m="555460">pick the particular weak classifiers to plug in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="557660">We've got a whole bag of classifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="560160">We've got H1, we've got H2, we've got H55.</span> </p>
<p><span m="562640">We've got a lot of them we can choose from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="564880">So what we're going to do is we're going to use the data,</span> <span m="572114">undisturbed, to produce H1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="577280">We're just going to try all the tests on the data and see</span> <span m="579330">which one gives us the smallest error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="581190">And that's the good guy, so we're going to use that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="584830">Then we're going to use the data with an</span> <span m="591300">exaggeration of H1 errors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="604560">In other words--</span> <span m="605560">this is a critical idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="606910">What we're going to do is we're going to run this</span> <span m="610060">algorithm again, but instead of just looking at the number</span> <span m="614010">of samples that are got wrong, what we're going to do is</span> <span m="621730">we're going to look at a distorted set of samples,</span> <span m="625370">where the ones we're not doing well on has exaggerated effect</span> <span m="629480">on the result.</span> </p>
<p><span m="631510">So we're going to weight them or multiply them, or do</span> <span m="635730">something so that we're going to pay more attention to the</span> <span m="640410">samples on which H1 produces an error, and that's going to</span> <span m="643810">give us H2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="647300">And then we're going to do it one more time, because we've</span> <span m="649830">got three things to go with here in this particular little</span> <span m="653410">exploratory scheme.</span> </p>
<p><span m="655100">And this time, we're going to have an</span> <span m="655970">exaggeration of those samples--</span> <span m="664390">which samples are we going to exaggerate now?</span> </p>
<p><span m="672250">We might as well look for the ones where H1 gives us a</span> <span m="674510">different answer from H2, because we want to be on the</span> <span m="677260">good guy's side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="679460">So we can say we're going to exaggerate those samples four</span> <span m="685070">which H1 gives us a different result from H2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="689120">And that's going to give us H3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="694210">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="695260">So we can think of this whole works here as part one of a</span> <span m="700530">multi-part idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="708680">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="709880">I don't know, what might be step two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="711260">Well, this is a good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="713420">Then what we've got that we can easily derive from that is</span> <span m="718540">a little tree looked like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="719910">And we can say that H of x depends on H1, H2, and H3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="729900">But now, if that that's a good idea, and that gives a better</span> <span m="734490">answer than any of the individual tests, maybe we can</span> <span m="738210">make this idea a little bit recursive, and say, well,</span> <span m="741460">maybe H1 is actually not an atomic test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="745550">But maybe it's the vote of three other tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="750010">So you can make a tree structure</span> <span m="751740">that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753750">So this is H11, H12, H13, and then 3 here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="760680">And then this will be H31, H32, H33.</span> </p>
<p><span m="768860">And so that's a sort of get out the vote idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="777200">We're trying to get a whole bunch of individual</span> <span m="780190">tests into the act.</span> </p>
<p><span m="783550">So I guess the reason this wasn't discovered until about</span> <span m="786920">'10 years ago was because you've got to get so many of</span> <span m="789650">these desks all lined up before the idea gets through</span> <span m="792520">that long filter of ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="795620">So that's the only idea number two of quite a few.</span> </p>
<p><span m="803350">Well, next thing we might think is, well, we keep</span> <span m="805900">talking about these classifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="807080">What kind of classifiers are we talking about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="810500">I've got--</span> <span m="811912">oh, shoot, I've spent my last nickel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="813740">I don't have a coin to flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815300">But that's one classifier, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="817810">The trouble with that classifier is it's a weak</span> <span m="821620">classifier, because it gives me a 50/50</span> <span m="823780">chance of being right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="826230">I guess there are conditions in which a coin flip</span> <span m="828460">is better than a--</span> <span m="830380">it is a weak classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="832900">If the two outcomes are not equally probable, than a coin</span> <span m="835680">flip is a perfectly good weak classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="838900">But what we're going to do is we're going to think in terms</span> <span m="841400">of a different set of classifiers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="845460">And we're going to call them decision tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852240">Now, you remember decision trees, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="854520">But we're not going to build decision trees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856000">We're going to use decision tree stumps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="863480">So if we have a two-dimensional space that</span> <span m="868640">looks like this, then a decision tree stump is a</span> <span m="874790">single test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="876540">It's not a complete tree that will divide up the samples</span> <span m="878750">into homogeneous groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880340">It's just what you can do with one test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="884330">So each possible test is a classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="888530">How many tests do we get out of that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="899280">12, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="900550">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901040">It doesn't look like 12 to me, either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902540">But here's how you get to 12.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905300">One decision tree test you can stick in there would be that</span> <span m="910460">test right there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="911390">And that would be a complete decision tree stump.</span> </p>
<p><span m="916040">But, of course, you can also put in this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="920315">That would be another decision tree stump.</span> </p>
<p><span m="923580">Now, for this one on the right, I could say, everything</span> <span m="926370">on the right is a minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="928730">Or, I could say, everything on the right is a plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="933520">It would happen to be wrong, but it's a valid test with a</span> <span m="937420">valid outcome.</span> </p>
<p><span m="939130">So that's how we double the number of test that</span> <span m="941130">we have lines for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943090">And you know what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="944050">can even have a kind of test out here that says everything</span> <span m="947280">is plus, or everything is wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="951190">So for each dimension, the number of decision tree stumps</span> <span m="955070">is the number of lines I can put in times 2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="959120">And then I've got two dimensions here, that's how I</span> <span m="960570">got to twelve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="962310">So there are three lines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="964470">I can have the pluses on either the left</span> <span m="966300">or the right side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="967070">So that's six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="968670">And then I've got two dimensions, so</span> <span m="969830">that gives me 12.</span> </p>
<p><span m="971750">So that's the decision tree stump idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="974050">And here are the other decision tree boundaries,</span> <span m="979180">obviously just like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="983940">So that's one way can generate a batch of tests to try out</span> <span m="990750">with this idea of using a lot of tests to help</span> <span m="995530">you get the job done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="996455">STUDENT: Couldn't you also have a decision tree on the</span> <span m="998558">right side?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1000370">PATRICK WINSTON: The question is, can you also have a test</span> <span m="1004330">on the right side?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1005420">See, this is just a stand-in for saying, everything's plus</span> <span m="1008530">or everything's minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1010260">So it doesn't matter where you put the line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1012530">It can be on the right side, or the left side, or the</span> <span m="1014362">bottom, or the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1015640">Or you don't have to put the line anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016940">It's just an extra test, an additional to the ones you put</span> <span m="1020640">between the samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1022810">So this whole idea of boosting, the</span> <span m="1026260">main idea of the day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027040">Does it depend on using decision tree stumps?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1029980">The answer is no.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1032490">Do not be confused.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1034390">You can use boosting with any kind of classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037800">so why do I use decision tree stumps today?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1041030">Because it makes my life easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1043660">We can look at it, we can see what it's doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1046420">But we could put bunch of neural nets in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1049790">We could put a bunch of real decision trees in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1053060">We could put a bunch of nearest</span> <span m="1055530">neighbor things in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1056660">The boosting idea doesn't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1059200">I just used these decision tree stumps because I and</span> <span m="1061880">everybody else use them for illustration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1065856">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1068270">We're making progress.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1070780">Now, what's the error rate for any these tests</span> <span m="1074470">and lines we drew?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1076240">Well, I guess it'll be the error rate is equal to the sum</span> <span m="1085110">of 1 over n--</span> <span m="1086770">That's the total number of points,</span> <span m="1089072">the number of samples--</span> <span m="1093810">summed over the cases where we are wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1102450">So gee, we're going to work on combining some of these ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106770">And we've got this notion of exaggeration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1109690">At some stage in what we're doing here, we're going to</span> <span m="1111980">want to be able to exaggerate the effect of some errors</span> <span m="1114280">relative to other errors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1116870">So one thing we can do is we can assume, or we can</span> <span m="1121700">stipulate, or we can assert that each of these samples has</span> <span m="1126620">a weight associated with it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127930">That's W1, this is W2, and that's W3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1133370">And in the beginning, there's no reason to suppose that any</span> <span m="1136140">one of these is more or less important</span> <span m="1137610">than any of the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1139160">So in the beginning, W sub i at time [? stub ?] one is</span> <span m="1145370">equal to 1 over n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150160">So the error is just adding up the number of samples that</span> <span m="1154170">were got wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1155730">And that'll be the fraction of samples to that</span> <span m="1158205">you didn't get right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159350">And that will be the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162010">So what we want to do is we want to say, instead of using</span> <span m="1166270">this as the error rate for all time, what we want to do is we</span> <span m="1170175">want to move that over, and say that the error rate is</span> <span m="1174140">equal to the sum over the things you got wrong in the</span> <span m="1179300">current step, times the weights of those</span> <span m="1183010">that were got wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1184770">So in step one, everything's got the same weight, it</span> <span m="1187140">doesn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1188200">But if we find a way to change their weights going</span> <span m="1190710">downstream--</span> <span m="1192750">so as to, for example, highly exaggerate that third sample,</span> <span m="1197750">then W3 will go up relative to W1 and W2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1203780">The one thing we want to be sure of is there is no matter</span> <span m="1206250">how we adjust the weights, that the sum of the weights</span> <span m="1211350">over the whole space is equal to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1217310">So in other words, we want to choose the weights so that</span> <span m="1219170">they emphasize some of the samples, but we also want to</span> <span m="1222130">put a constraint on the weights such that all of them</span> <span m="1225510">added together is summing to one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230200">And we'll say that that enforces a distribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1235938">A distribution is a set of weights that sum to one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1241400">Well, that's just a nice idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1245570">So we're make a little progress.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1246780">We've got this idea that we can add some plus/minus 1</span> <span m="1251750">classifiers together, you get a better classifier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1255130">We got some idea about how to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1258480">It occurs to us that maybe we want to get a lot of</span> <span m="1260080">classifiers into the act somehow or another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1263500">And maybe we want to think about using decision tree</span> <span m="1267000">stumps so as to ground out thinking about all this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1271220">So the next step is to say, well, how actually should we</span> <span m="1276830">combine this stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1279040">And you will find, in the literature libraries, full of</span> <span m="1281800">papers that do stuff like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1284550">And that was state of the art for quite a few years.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1288090">But then people began to say, well, maybe we can build up</span> <span m="1292390">this classifier, H of x, in multiple steps and get a lot</span> <span m="1297350">of classifiers into the act.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1300090">So maybe we can say that the classifier is the sign of H--</span> <span m="1311786">that's the one we picked first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314130">That's the classifier we picked first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1316990">That's looking at samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318490">And then we've got H2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1320790">And then we've got H3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1323090">And then we've got how many other classifiers we might</span> <span m="1326220">want, or how many classifiers we might need in order to</span> <span m="1331620">correctly classify everything in our sample set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1336800">So people began to think about whether there might be an</span> <span m="1339760">algorithm that would develop a classifier that way,</span> <span m="1342560">one step at a time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1346240">That's why I put that step number in the exponent,</span> <span m="1349660">because we're picking this one at first, then we're expanding</span> <span m="1353280">it to have two, and then we're expanding it to have</span> <span m="1355010">three, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1356620">And each of those individual classifiers are separately</span> <span m="1358960">looking at the sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1362530">But of course, it would be natural to suppose that just</span> <span m="1366380">adding things up wouldn't be enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1369150">And it's not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1370870">So it isn't too hard to invent the next idea, which is to</span> <span m="1374690">modify this thing just a little bit by doing what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380250">It looks almost like a scoring polynomial, doesn't it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384420">So what would we do to tart this up a little bit?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1388308">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391050">PATRICK WINSTON: Come again?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391955">Do what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1393380">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396230">PATRICK WINSTON: Somewhere out there someone's murmuring.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399360">STUDENT: Add--</span> <span m="1399815">PATRICK WINSTON: Add weights!</span> </p>
<p><span m="1401100">STUDENT: --weights.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1401505">Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1401910">PATRICK WINSTON: Excellent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402185">Good idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1404040">So what we're going to do is we're going to have alphas</span> <span m="1408320">associated with each of these classifiers, and we're going</span> <span m="1412105">to determine if somebody can build that kind</span> <span m="1414240">formula to do the job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1418790">So maybe I ought to modify this gold star idea before I</span> <span m="1421780">get too far downstream.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1424250">And we're not going to treat everybody in a crowd equally.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1432240">We're going to wait some of the opinions more than others.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1435760">And by the way, they're all going to make errors in</span> <span m="1437790">different parts of the space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1440910">So maybe it's not the wisdom of even a weighted crowd, but</span> <span m="1445775">a crowd of experts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452360">Each of which is good at different parts of the space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456860">So anyhow, we've got this formula, and there are a few</span> <span m="1459770">things that one can say turn out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1465780">But first, let's write down the an algorithm for what this</span> <span m="1471530">ought to look like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1473140">Before I run out of space, I think I'll exploit the right</span> <span m="1475810">hand board here, and put the overall algorithm right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1481110">So we're going to start out by letting of all the weights at</span> <span m="1487410">time 1 be equal to 1 over n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1493570">That's just saying that they're all equal in the</span> <span m="1496330">beginning, and they're equal to 1 over n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1499170">And n is the number of samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1506090">And then, when I've got that, I want to</span> <span m="1511130">compute alpha, somehow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1517510">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518780">No, I don't want to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1520210">I want to</span> <span m="1522810">I want to pick a classifier the minimizes the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1537730">And then m, i, zes, error at time t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1543050">And that's going to be at time t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1545230">And we're going to come back in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546340">That's why we put a step index in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550160">So once we've picked a classifier that produces an</span> <span m="1556790">error rate, then we can use the error rate to</span> <span m="1559210">determine the alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1560350">So I want the alpha over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1567910">That'll be sort of a byproduct of picking that test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1571900">And with all that stuff in hand, maybe that will be</span> <span m="1574890">enough to calculate Wt plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1588600">So we're going to use that classifier that we just picked</span> <span m="1593162">to get some revised weights, and then we're going to go</span> <span m="1596040">around that loop until this classifier produces a perfect</span> <span m="1601870">set of conclusions on all the sample data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1606290">So that's going to be our overall strategy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1609560">Maybe we've got, if we're going to number these things,</span> <span m="1611800">that's the fourth big idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1614960">And this arrangement here is the fifth big idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1619350">Then we've got the sixth big idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1621390">And the sixth big idea says this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1626940">Suppose that the weight on it ith sample at time t plus 1 is</span> <span m="1639340">equal to the weight at time t on that same sample, divided</span> <span m="1648600">by some normalizing factor, times e to the minus alpha at</span> <span m="1658150">time t, times h at time t, times some function y which is</span> <span m="1672750">a function of x, But not a function of time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1678160">Now you say, where did this come from?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681280">And the answer is, it did not spring from the heart of</span> <span m="1683670">mathematician in the first 10 minutes that he</span> <span m="1686190">looked at this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1687800">In fact, when I asked [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1689550">how this worked, he said, well, he was thinking about</span> <span m="1693300">this on the couch every Saturday for about a year, and</span> <span m="1695630">his wife was getting pretty sore, but he finally found it</span> <span m="1698200">and saved their marriage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700590">So where does stuff like this come from?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1703950">Really, it comes from knowing a lot of mathematics, and</span> <span m="1707080">seeing a lot of situations, and knowing that something</span> <span m="1709280">like this might be mathematically convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714570">Something like this might be mathematically convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1720080">But we've got to back up a little and let it sing to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1722670">What's y?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724010">We saw y last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725100">The support vector machines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1726910">That's just a function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1727780">That's plus 1 or minus 1, depending on whether the</span> <span m="1731270">output ought to be plus 1 or minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1735310">So if this guy is giving the correct answer, and the</span> <span m="1742200">correct answer is plus, and then this guy will be plus 1</span> <span m="1746630">too, because it always gives you the correct answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1750210">So in that case, where this guy is giving the right</span> <span m="1752330">answer, these will have the same sign, so that will be a</span> <span m="1755190">plus 1 combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1756960">On the other hand, if that guy's giving the wrong answer,</span> <span m="1759000">you're going to get a minus 1 out of that combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762450">So it's true even if the right answer should be minus, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1765680">So if the right answer should be minus, and this is plus,</span> <span m="1768320">then this will be minus 1, and the whole combination well</span> <span m="1770820">give you minus 1 again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1771945">In other words, the y just flips the sign if you've got</span> <span m="1776360">the wrong answer, no matter whether the wrong answer is</span> <span m="1779170">plus 1 or minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1782330">These alphas--</span> <span m="1783650">shoot, those are the same alphas that are in this</span> <span m="1786420">formula up here, somehow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1789950">And then that z, what's that for?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1792840">Well, if you just look at the previous weights, and its</span> <span m="1795650">exponential function to produce these W's for the next</span> <span m="1800900">generation, that's not going to be a distribution, because</span> <span m="1804910">they won't sum up to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1807620">So what this thing here, this z is, that's a sort of</span> <span m="1811470">normalizer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818750">And that makes that whole combination of new</span> <span m="1821680">weights add up to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823980">So it's whatever you got by adding up all those guys, and</span> <span m="1831570">then dividing by that number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834660">Well, phew.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1843030">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1844350">Now there's some it-turns-out-thats.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1850360">We're going to imagine that somebody's done the same sort</span> <span m="1852230">of thing we did to the support vector machines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1854940">We're going to find a way to minimize the error.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1857730">And the error we're going to minimize is the error produced</span> <span m="1859540">by that whole thing up there in 4.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1862420">We're going to minimize the error of that entire</span> <span m="1865120">expression as we go along.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1868930">And what we discover when we do the appropriate</span> <span m="1871970">differentiations and stuff--</span> <span m="1873775">you know, that's what we do in calculus--</span> <span m="1875710">what we discover is that you get minimum error for the</span> <span m="1884580">whole thing if alpha is equal to 1 minus the error rate at</span> <span m="1905970">time t, divided by the error rate at time t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911190">Now let's take the logarithm of that, and</span> <span m="1913950">multiply it by half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1916220">And that's what [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1917140">was struggling to find.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1919880">But we haven't quite got it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1921350">And so let me add this in separate chunks, so we don't</span> <span m="1923800">get confused about this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1925926">It's a bound on that expression up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1932880">It's a bound on the error rate produced by that expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936510">So interestingly enough, this means that the error rate can</span> <span m="1942540">actually go up as you add terms to this formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1946000">all you know is that the error rate is going to be bounded by</span> <span m="1948560">an exponentially decaying function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1952080">So it's eventually guaranteed to converge on zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1956910">So it's a minimal error bound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1958260">It turns out to be exponential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1963120">Well, there it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1965630">We're done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1966120">Would you like to see a demonstration?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1968207">Yeah, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969550">Because you look at that, and you say, well, how could</span> <span m="1971260">anything like that possibly work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1973800">And the answer is, surprisingly enough, here's</span> <span m="1977120">what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1979720">There's a simple little example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1982440">So that's the first test chosen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985310">the greens are pluses and the reds are minuses, so it's</span> <span m="1989470">still got an error.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1991480">Still got an error-- boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1992620">There, in two steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1993830">It now has--</span> <span m="1994600">we can look in the upper right hand corner--</span> <span m="1996670">we see its used three classifiers, and we see that</span> <span m="2000460">one of those classifiers says that everybody belongs to a</span> <span m="2002900">particular class, three different weights.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2007250">And the error rate has converged to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010540">So let's look at a couple of other ones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2012170">Here is the one I use for debugging this thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2015060">We'll let that run.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2016250">See how fast it is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2017690">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2018710">It converges to getting all the samples right very fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022800">Here's another one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2024190">This is one we gave on an exam a few years back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2027350">First test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028670">Oh, I let it run, so it got everything</span> <span m="2030620">instantaneously right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2032380">Let's take that through step at a time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033950">There's the first one, second one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2036940">Still got a lot of errors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2038800">Ah, the error rate's dropping.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2041600">And then flattened, flattened, and it goes to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2046160">Cool, don't you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048000">But you say to me, bah, who cares about that stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2050010">Let's try something more interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2051540">There's one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2054190">That was pretty fast, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055500">Well, there's not too many samples here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2057090">So we can try this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060030">So there's an array of pluses and minuses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2062230">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2062940">You can see how that error rate is bounded by an</span> <span m="2064920">exponential?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2067920">So in a bottom graph, you've got the number of classifiers</span> <span m="2072800">involved, and that goes up to a total, eventually, of 10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2076650">You can see how positive or negative each of the</span> <span m="2081230">classifiers that's added is by looking at</span> <span m="2083530">this particular tab.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085270">And this just shows how they evolve over time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2088045">But the progress thing here is the most interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2092239">And now you say to me, well, how did the machine do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2097420">And it's all right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2100330">We use an alpha that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2105400">And that allows us to compute the new weights.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2108400">It says we've got a preliminary calculation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2110150">We've got to find a z that does the normalization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2113630">And we sure better bring our calculator, because we've got,</span> <span m="2117640">first of all, to calculate the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2119350">Then we've got to take its logarithm, divide by 2, plug</span> <span m="2122365">it into that formula, take the exponent, and that gives us</span> <span m="2127290">the new weight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2128210">And that's how the program works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2129460">And if you try that, I guarantee you</span> <span m="2130880">will flunk the exam.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2133130">Now, I don't care about my computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2134940">I really don't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2135920">It's a slave, and it can calculate these logarithm and</span> <span m="2139050">exponentials till it turns blue, and I don't care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2141840">Because I've got four cores or something, and who cares.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2144740">Might as well do this, than sit around</span> <span m="2146220">just burning up heat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148391">But you don't want to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2149640">So what you want to do is you want to know how to do this</span> <span m="2153010">sort of thing more expeditiously.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2157240">So we're going to have to let them the math sing to us a</span> <span m="2160720">little bit, with a view towards finding better ways of</span> <span m="2165470">doing this sort of thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2168290">So let's do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2171700">And we're going to run out of space here before long, so let</span> <span m="2174080">me reclaim as much of this board as I can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178450">So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, well, now that</span> <span m="2180940">we've got this formula for alpha that relates alpha t to</span> <span m="2185720">the error, then I can plug that into this formula up</span> <span m="2191530">here, number 6.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2192345">And what I'll get is that the weight of t plus 1 is equal to</span> <span m="2200390">the weight at t divided by that normalizing factor,</span> <span m="2206710">multiplied times something that depends on whether it's</span> <span m="2213350">categorized correctly or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215600">That's what that y's in their for, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219660">So we've got a logarithm here, and we got a sign flipper up</span> <span m="2225630">there in terms of that H of x and y combination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230690">So if the sign of that whole thing at minus alpha and that</span> <span m="2238220">y H combination turns out to be negative, then we're going</span> <span m="2243900">to have to flip the numerator and denominator here in this</span> <span m="2247740">logarithm, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2249620">And oh, by the way, since we've got a half out here,</span> <span m="2252250">that turns out to be the square root of that term</span> <span m="2254170">inside the logarithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2257190">So when we carefully do that, what we discover is that it</span> <span m="2263290">depends on whether it's the right thing or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2266430">But what it turns out to be is something like a multiplier of</span> <span m="2270860">the square root.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2273750">Better be careful, here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2275960">The square root of what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2279300">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282030">PATRICK WINSTON: Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282860">But we have to be careful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284180">So let's suppose that this is 4 things that we get correct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293740">So if we get it correct, then we're going to get the same</span> <span m="2297910">sign out of H of x and y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300200">We've get a minus sign out there, so we're going to flip</span> <span m="2302350">the numerator and denominator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2305500">So we're going to get the square root of e of t over 1</span> <span m="2310460">minus epsilon of t if that's correct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2314110">If it's wrong, it'll just be the flip of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2319350">So it'll be the square root of 1 minus the error rate over</span> <span m="2324690">the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2328570">Everybody with me on that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2329740">I think that's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2331620">If it's wrong, I'll have to hang myself and wear a paper</span> <span m="2335930">bag over my head like I did last year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2337760">But let's see if we can make this go correctly this time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345730">So now, we've got this guy here, we've got everything</span> <span m="2352430">plugged in all right, and we know that now this z ought to</span> <span m="2358110">be selected so that it's equal to the sum of this guy</span> <span m="2362630">multiplied by these things as appropriate for whether it's</span> <span m="2365070">correct or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2368220">Because we want, in the end, for all of these w's</span> <span m="2371710">to add up to 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374320">So let's see what they add up to without the z there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2379830">So what we know is that it must be the case that if we</span> <span m="2384840">add over the correct ones, we get the square root of the</span> <span m="2393670">error rate over 1 minus the rate of the Wt plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404100">Plus now we've got the sum of 1 minus the error rate over</span> <span m="2409520">the error rate, times the sum of the Wi at time t for wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424340">So that's what we get if we added all these</span> <span m="2427320">up without the z.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2430420">So since everything has to add up to 1, then z ought to be</span> <span m="2433400">equal to this sum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2443880">That looks pretty horrible, until we realize that if we</span> <span m="2447960">add these guys up over the weights that are wrong, that</span> <span m="2451930">is the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2455880">This is e.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2459850">So therefore, z is equal the square root of the error rate</span> <span m="2468540">times 1 minus the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470710">That's the contribution of this term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474040">Now, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2475310">What is the sum of the weights over the</span> <span m="2477700">ones that are correct?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2480320">Well, that must be 1 minus the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2485020">Ah, so this thing gives you the same result as this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490290">So z is equal to 2 times that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494170">And that's a good thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2498580">Now we are getting somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2500540">Because now, it becomes a little bit easier to write</span> <span m="2504380">some things down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2506490">Well, we're way past this, so let's get rid of this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514090">And now we can put some things together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2517940">Let me point out what I'm putting together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2520910">I've got an expression for z right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2526560">And I've got an expression for the new w's here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531320">So let's put those together and say that w of t plus 1 is</span> <span m="2539020">equal to w of t.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543150">I guess we're going to divide that by 2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2546090">And then we've got this square root times that expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2553470">So if we take that correct one, and divide by that one,</span> <span m="2560470">then the [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="2564970">cancel out, and I get 1 over 1 minus the error rate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2573560">That's it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2573850">That's correct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2579880">And if it's not correct, then it's Wt over 2--</span> <span m="2584620">and working through the math--</span> <span m="2585670">1 over epsilon, if wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2591950">Do we feel like we're making any progress?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2595130">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2596030">Because we haven't let it sing to us enough yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2599090">So I want to draw your attention to what happens to</span> <span m="2605130">amateur rock climbers when they're halfway</span> <span m="2608500">up a difficult cliff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2611360">They're usually [INAUDIBLE], sometimes they're not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2613570">If they're not, they're scared to death.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2616800">And every once in a while, as they're just about to fall,</span> <span m="2620850">they find some little tiny hole to stick a fingernail in,</span> <span m="2624410">and that keeps them from falling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2626510">That's called a thank-god hole.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630440">So what I'm about to introduce is the analog of those little</span> <span m="2633680">places where you can stick your fingernail in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2635530">It's the thank-god hole for dealing</span> <span m="2637380">with boosting problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2644680">So what happens if I add all these [? Wi ?]</span> <span m="2647370">up for the ones that the classifier where produces a</span> <span m="2652470">correct answer on?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2656050">Well, it'll be 1 over 2, and 1 over 1 minus epsilon, times</span> <span m="2662110">the sum of the Wt for which the answer was correct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2669490">What's this sum?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2671781">Oh!</span> </p>
<p><span m="2672450">My goddess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2674480">1 minus epsilon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2678920">So what I've just discovered is that if I sum new w's over</span> <span m="2690920">those samples for which I got a correct answer,</span> <span m="2693880">it's equal to 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696490">And guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2697130">That means that if I sum them over wrong, it's equal to 1/2</span> <span m="2703240">half as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2707710">So that means that I take all of the weight for which I got</span> <span m="2711300">the right answer with the previous test, and those ways</span> <span m="2718000">will add up to something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2719990">And to get the weights for the next generation, all I have to</span> <span m="2722263">do is scale them so that they equal half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724780">This was not noticed by the people who</span> <span m="2726710">developed this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2727000">This was noticed by Luis Ortiz, who was a 6.034</span> <span m="2731210">instructor a few years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2734160">The sum of those weights is going to be a scaled version</span> <span m="2738660">of what they were before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741400">So you take all the weights for which this new</span> <span m="2743340">classifier--</span> <span m="2744590">this one you selected to give you the minimum weight on the</span> <span m="2746890">re-weighted stuff--</span> <span m="2748050">you take the ones that it gives a correct answer for,</span> <span m="2750520">and you take all of those weights, and you just scale</span> <span m="2752775">them so they add up to 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2755770">So do you have to compute any logarithms?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2758730">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2759670">Do you have to compute any exponentials?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761320">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2762230">Do you have to calculate z?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2763790">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2765170">Do you have to calculate alpha to get the new weights?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767120">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767755">All you have to do is scale them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2769690">And that's a pretty good thank-god hole.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2772730">So that's thank-god hole number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2781890">Now, for thank-god hole number two, we need to go back and</span> <span m="2786340">think about the fact that were going to give you problems in</span> <span m="2788720">probability that involve decision tree stumps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2792940">And there are a lot of decision tree stumps that you</span> <span m="2795790">might have to pick from.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2798050">So we need a thank-god hole for deciding how</span> <span m="2799940">to deal with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2802320">Where can I find some room?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2803330">How about right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2813870">Suppose you've got a space that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2822810">I'm just makings this up at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2826020">So how many--</span> <span m="2827020">let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2827180">1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2831300">How many tests do I have to consider in that dimension?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837598">11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2839077">It's 1 plus the number of samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2842060">That would be horrible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2846590">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2847080">Do I have actually calculate this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2853040">How could that possibly be better than that one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2856430">It's got one more thing wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2859930">So that one makes sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2865570">The other one doesn't make sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2868940">So in the end, no test that lies between two correctly</span> <span m="2875520">classified samples will ever be any good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2878530">So that one's a good guy, and that one's a good guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2881830">And this one's a bad guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2882870">Bad guy, bad guy bad guy, bad guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2885600">Bad guy, bad guy, bad buy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2888910">So the actual number of tests you've got is three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2894410">And likewise, in the other dimension--</span> <span m="2897770">well, I haven't drawn it so well here, but would this test</span> <span m="2899960">be a good one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2900660">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901320">That one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2901690">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2904760">Actually, I'd better look over here on the right and see what</span> <span m="2906465">I've got before I draw too many conclusions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2908400">Let's look over this, since I don't want to think too hard</span> <span m="2910870">about what's going on in the other dimension.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2912980">But the idea is that very few of those</span> <span m="2915270">tests actually matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2918240">Now, you say to me, there's one last thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2919770">What about overfitting?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2921762">Because all this does is drape a solution over the samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2925800">And like support vector machines overfit, neural maps</span> <span m="2929110">overfit, identification trees overfit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2932580">Guess what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2933820">This doesn't seem to overfit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2936290">That's an experimental result for which the</span> <span m="2939130">literature is confused.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2941470">It goes back to providing an explanation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2943920">So this stuff is tried on all sorts of problems, like</span> <span m="2946210">handwriting recognition, understanding speech, all</span> <span m="2950100">sorts of stuff uses boosting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2952180">And unlike other methods, for some reason as yet imperfectly</span> <span m="2956010">understood, it doesn't seem to overfit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2960260">But in the end, they leave no stone unturned in 6.034.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2965550">Every time we do this, we do some additional experiments.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2968670">So here's a sample that I'll leave you with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2972410">Here's a situation in which we have a 10-dimensional space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2976130">We've made a fake distribution, and then we put</span> <span m="2978270">in that boxed outlier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2980270">That was just put into the space at random, so it can be</span> <span m="2982630">viewed as an error point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2985230">So now what we're going to do is we're going to see what</span> <span m="2987240">happens when we run that guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2989560">And sure enough, in 17 steps, it finds a solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2995140">But maybe it's overfit that little guy who's an error.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2999620">But one thing you can do is you can say, well, all of</span> <span m="3003000">these classifiers are dividing this space up into chunks, and</span> <span m="3006890">we can compute the size of the space occupied by any sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3011750">So one thing we can do--</span> <span m="3013650">alas, I'll have to get up a new demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3016370">One thing we can do, now that this guy's over here, we can</span> <span m="3019750">switch the volume tab and watch how the volume occupied</span> <span m="3023310">by that error point evolves as we solve the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3029640">So look what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3031820">This is, of course, randomly generated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3033380">I'm counting on this working.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3035390">Never failed before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3039930">So it originally starts out as occupying 26%</span> <span m="3044510">of the total volume.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3047020">It ends up occupying 1.4 times 10 to the</span> <span m="3052360">minus 3rd% of the volume.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3055910">So what tends to happen is that these decision tree</span> <span m="3060060">stumps tend to wrap themselves so tightly around the error</span> <span m="3063190">points, there's no room for overfitting, because nothing</span> <span m="3065350">else will fit in that same volume.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3067550">So that's why I think that this thing tends to produce</span> <span m="3070390">solutions which don't overfit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3072430">So in conclusion, this is magic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3074970">You always want to use it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3076010">It'll work with any kind of [? speed ?] of</span> <span m="3077510">classifiers you want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3079090">And you should understand it very thoroughly, because of</span> <span m="3081590">anything is useful in the subject in dimension learning,</span> <span m="3085740">this is it.</span> </p>

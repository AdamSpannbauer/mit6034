<p><span m="8119">What we're going to talk about today, is goals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="11389">So just by way of a little warm up exercise, I'd like you to look at that integration problem</span> <span m="17550">over there. The one that's disappeared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="40750">So the question is, can you do it in your head? Probably not. The question is, if a</span> <span m="47840">program can do that, is a program, in any sense of the word, intelligent? That's a background</span> <span m="55260">task I'd like you to work on as I talk today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="58880">So today we're going to be modeling a little bit of human</span> <span m="61000">problem solving, the kind that</span> <span m="62720">is required when you do symbolic integration. Now, you all learned how to do that. You may</span> <span m="67100">not be able to do that particular problem anymore, but you all learned how to integrate</span> <span m="70579">in high school 1801, or something like that. The question is, how did you do it, and is</span> <span m="76950">the problem solving technique that we are trying to model by building a program that</span> <span m="82539">does symbolic integration, is that a common kind of description of what people do when</span> <span m="89610">they solve problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="91110">So the answer to the question is, yes. The kind of problem solving you'll see</span> <span m="94150">today is like generating tests, which you saw last time. It's a very common kind of</span> <span m="99280">problem solving that we all engage in, that we all engage in without thinking about it,</span> <span m="104799">and without having a name for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106650">But once we get a name for it, we'll get power over it. And then we'll be able to deploy</span> <span m="111470">it, and it will become a skill. We'll not just witness it, we'll not just understand</span> <span m="115658">it, we'll use it instinctively, as a skill.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120950">So there you are, you've got that problem, there's your problem, and what do you do to</span> <span m="124650">solve it? I don't know, look it up in a table? You'll never find it in a table because of</span> <span m="132060">that minus sign and that 5. So you're going to have to do something better than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="141670">So what you're going to do, is what you always do when you see a problem like that. You try</span> <span m="146640">to apply a transform, and make it into a different problem that's easier to solve. And eventually,</span> <span m="151090">what you hope is that you'll simplify it sufficiently, that the pieces that you've simplified to</span> <span m="158040">will be found in some small table of integrals. So how long is this table? It's not the case</span> <span m="164450">that we're going to look at a table with 388 elements, because this is not a big table</span> <span m="168690">of integrals. This is what a freshman might have in a freshman's head, after taking a</span> <span m="172860">course in integral calculus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="175739">One of the interesting questions is, how many elements have to be in that table to get an</span> <span m="180400">A in the course? We're interested in how much knowledge is involved, that's one of the elements</span> <span m="185180">of catechism that I've listed over there, that will be part of the gold star ideas suite</span> <span m="189980">of the day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="192400">So we'd like to take that problem, and find a way to make it into another problem that's</span> <span m="199769">more likely, or closer to being found in the table. So what we're going to do is very simple,</span> <span m="205800">graphically. We're going to take the problem we're given, and convert it into another problem</span> <span m="211720">that's simpler. And we're going to give that process and name, and we're going to call</span> <span m="215579">it problem reduction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="226900">And so, in the world of integral calculus, there are all sorts of simple methods, simple</span> <span m="234269">transformations, we can try that will take a hard problem and make it into an easier</span> <span m="240010">problem. And some of these transformations are extremely simple and always safe. Some</span> <span m="247659">of them are just, well let's try it and see what happens. But some of them are safe, and</span> <span m="252629">I'd like to make a short list of safe transformations right now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="258879">Now I'm going to be going into some detail. And that detail will be grungy. And the question</span> <span m="265490">is, why do I do it? And it's educational philosophy, is why I do it. So here's the educational</span> <span m="270159">philosophy. At one level, you want to have a skill. But if you're going to have a skill,</span> <span m="278110">you have to understand it. So if you're going to have a skill you have to understand it</span> <span m="287629">one level down. If you're going to understand it, you have to have witnessed it on a level</span> <span m="294330">lower than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="296389">So I'm not just going to talk about the idea of problem reduction, because if I were just</span> <span m="300569">going to do that, then we could all go home now. So I'm going to show you a particular</span> <span m="305969">example of it, so you understand it better, and I'm going to show you the detail at an</span> <span m="310919">even lower level than that. So you will witness the stuff that makes it possible, to understand</span> <span m="315199">the stuff that makes it possible, to build a skill. So that's why I'm going through the</span> <span m="319419">grungy detail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="321539">So I don't know, let's see. Maybe we can get some hints from that example, but I wonder</span> <span m="327349">if somebody could volunteer a simple transformation that always is a good thing to do. Yes, Sebastian.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334569">AUDIENCE: Take the constants out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="335729">SPEAKER 1: Take the constants out. So we'll make that number two. And we'll say that the</span> <span m="341819">integral c f of x dx is equal to c times the integral f of x dx. Other suggestions? Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="353680">AUDIENCE: Trig substitution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="356449">SPEAKER 1: Trig substitution. Now this is-- no, that's for day two. We don't do trig substitution</span> <span m="363569">here under stuff that's safe, always works, never any doubt, there are simpler things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="370229">These are the safe transformations. What you're giving me is a heuristic transformation. Often</span> <span m="377319">is helpful, doesn't necessarily always work. We're going to divide our transformations</span> <span m="382779">into those two categories. So I need another safe one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="386729">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="389830">SPEAKER 1: The architects are sitting over there. Divided not only by nationality, but</span> <span m="397740">by course. What?</span> </p>
<p><span m="400020">AUDIENCE: The sum of integrals is the integral of the sum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="403280">SPEAKER 1: The sum of integrals is the integral of the sum. Now what's missing? What's number</span> <span m="425360">one? You're probably thinking it's already there, because you've given me the transformation</span> <span m="431229">that involves a constant. And you can think of minus 1 as a constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="436159">But whether you use a separate transformation or not, of course depends on how you represent</span> <span m="440270">the knowledge. And all of this knowledge, all of this whole thing, was written in an</span> <span m="445889">early form of Lisp. As a consequence, the way in which minus was represented is different</span> <span m="452749">from the way minus 1 is represented. So we need one more transformation. Or rather, Jim</span> <span m="458069">Slagle needed one more transformation, when he wrote his famous transformation program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="462469">And that was that if you have the integral of minus f of x, that's equal to, minus the</span> <span m="473599">integral of f of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="476989">So that almost completes our safe transformation set. There's one more that I'm going to supply</span> <span m="481099">you, because I don't think you'd guess it. Why should you? It's number four. There are</span> <span m="485800">more than this, this is a sample. And these are the ones we're going to need in order</span> <span m="491489">to solve that problem, by way of illustration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="494989">So the fourth one is that, if you have the integral of p of x, over q of x, then you</span> <span m="504439">divide. If you can reach way back into high school and figure out how to divide polynomials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="511159">But if the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, then it's</span> <span m="517179">a knee-jerk always win, you must do it, divide it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522120">So this, then, forms the core of an integration program, that will integrate almost nothing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="530259">But actually, almost nothing is integrable anyway, so it's a good head start. So let's</span> <span m="536490">see how we would put this into some kind of procedure. Some kind of framework for deploying</span> <span m="545620">the knowledge that we're beginning to develop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="552600">What we're going to do is, apply all safe transforms. That's our first step. Then we're</span> <span m="572920">going to look in the table, and then we're going to do a test to see if we're done. And</span> <span m="592440">if we are, we report success. But, we're not likely to get done with just that stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="602410">But you know what, there was one transformation up here, which breaks my little diagram. Which</span> <span m="610000">one is it? It's the third one, right? Because this picture does not reflect what happens</span> <span m="619709">when you apply number three. Because it breaks the problem up, not into just one problem,</span> <span m="624680">but into a whole bunch. So we have to extend our graphical device for talking about this</span> <span m="633240">by a little bit, and show what is called an "and node".</span> </p>
<p><span m="647220">So we've got a program core, we've got a table of integrals, we've got a few transformations,</span> <span m="655230">we've got an architecture, a way of putting that stuff together. And now we can try it</span> <span m="659810">out on our sample problem. So let's have a go at that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="666370">Let's see, this one immediately transforms into 5x to the fourth over 1 minus x squared</span> <span m="680149">to the 5/2 dx. And that in turn, immediately transforms into the integral of x to the fourth</span> <span m="688649">over 1 minus x squared to the 5/2, dx.</span> </p>
<p><span m="696620">This program, by the way, is a dawn-age program. This was written by a nearly blind, and subsequently</span> <span m="702699">completely blind, graduate student by the name of James Slagle in 1960, a long time</span> <span m="708319">ago. The reason I gave it to you today is because, that by describing it, I am giving</span> <span m="714509">you a one-lecture course in artificial intelligence. He anticipated so much of the subsequent 20</span> <span m="721079">years, that talking about his program, which is possible in one day, is a miniature introduction</span> <span m="728689">to the whole field.</span> </p>
<p><span m="730389">So Slagle, as he was doing this on an antique computer, almost no memory, almost no speed,</span> <span m="737899">only slightly faster than mice running around on a treadmill. He was able to write a program</span> <span m="745019">that did extremely well when benchmarked against freshmen. And the way you benchmark against</span> <span m="751769">freshman, of course, is you give it an examination, drawn from the previous MIT finals for four</span> <span m="759249">or five years, the hardest problems. And this was the hardest problem that it solved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="766100">So at this point, with what we've got so far, we would be stuck. We have no transformation</span> <span m="771769">that can take us further, so we need something else. And what we need by way of something</span> <span m="779540">else, is some transformations that we will describe as-- perhaps we'll call them, heuristic</span> <span m="788939">transformations. A funny word, meaning a method that often works isn't guaranteed to work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="800279">It's not an algorithm in the usual sense that we talk about algorithms. But rather, it's</span> <span m="807540">an attempt.</span> </p>
<p><span m="809430">So these things I'm going to talk about now, are sometimes useful, not always useful. Sometimes</span> <span m="815519">take you into a blind alley, don' always work. But you can't get an A in calculus without</span> <span m="822209">knowing some of them. So you said, some kind of trig substitution. So here is some kind</span> <span m="829379">of trig substitution. We'll call this heuristic transformation A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="836329">You have a function sine x, cosine x, tangent of x, cotangent of x, secant of x, and cosecant</span> <span m="850790">of x. And we all know from high school trigonometry, that we can rewrite that as a function of</span> <span m="860899">sine x, and cosine x. Or we can rewrite that as a function of tangent of x, and cosecant</span> <span m="876990">of x. Or we can rewrite that as function of cotangent of x, and the secant of x. So that's</span> <span m="891550">a transmission from trigonometric form, into another trigonometric form. It's not always</span> <span m="897089">a good idea, sometimes it helps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902990">Well that's just part one of our suite of heuristic transformations. Stop. There are</span> <span m="925370">others that we need to have in our repertoire, in order to solve the problem. One of them</span> <span m="932459">is a family of transformations, which I'll show you only one. It goes like this, if you</span> <span m="938629">have the integral of a function, of the tangent of x, then you can rewrite that as the integral</span> <span m="953899">of a function of y over 1 plus y squared dy. So that's a transformation from a trigonometric</span> <span m="965850">form into a polynomial form. So it gets rid of all that trigonometric garbage we don't</span> <span m="971360">want to deal with. And there's a whole family of things like that, just as there's a family</span> <span m="977319">of transformations like so, but this is enough to give you flavor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="982699">Now there's a C that we need as well. And that's going to be your proper knee-jerk reaction</span> <span m="990949">when you see something of the form 1 minus x squared. What do you do when you see that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="999640">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1000660">What's that Rhana?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001940">Rhana: 1 + 6  * 1 - 6</span> <span m="1004380">Well wait a second. We could do that. But there's another thing we can do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1009180">Christian, have you got something you can suggest? Where's our Hungarian? Our Turk,</span> <span m="1017260">our young Turk. Yeah, what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1022460">AUDIENCE: I actually don't remember. I mean, I think it might have been 10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027060">SPEAKER 1: Well, let's see. Cosine squared plus sine squared equals 1. So, what's that</span> <span m="1031859">suggest to you? So it suggests that we make a transformation that involves x equals sine</span> <span m="1042060">y. So [? Silla ?] doesn't actually have to remember that anymore because going forward,</span> <span m="1047648">she will never have to integrate anything personally in her life, she can just simulate</span> <span m="1051640">the program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1069010">So these go from polynomial form, back into trigonometric form. So you have three of these</span> <span m="1073760">heuristic transformations. We've got four safe transformations. Let's see if we can</span> <span m="1079289">make any progress on our integration problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1091160">OK so keeping track of what we've been using, this is safe transformation number one, this</span> <span m="1099610">is safe transformation number two. What do we do next? We decided there were no more</span> <span m="1104890">safe transformations that apply. But now we can look at our heuristic transformations</span> <span m="1111190">and behold, we see what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1115150">AUDIENCE: C</span> <span m="1115820">SPEAKER 1: What?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1116920">AUDIENCE: Applying transformation C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1118470">SPEAKER 1: Transformation C suggests that we do x equals the sine y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1130710">And now we get the integral of sine to the</span> <span m="1137490">fourth y over cosine to the fourth y dy, right. All good, I see some confused, worried, concerned</span> <span m="1151380">looks. Maybe I've made a mistake, perhaps I should use notes. Well no, wait a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1159320">For those of you who have a concerned look, remember that if x equals a sine y, then dx</span> <span m="1166429">is equal to cosine y dy. That's why it's cosine to the fourth not cosine to the fifth, as</span> <span m="1173940">you were perhaps thinking it might be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1178580">So now we've made some progress. We look at this, we say, are there any safe transformations</span> <span m="1185880">that apply? And the answer is, no. Now we look for a heuristic transformation that might</span> <span m="1192450">apply, and I say, what do you see? Which one? What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1198029">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1205880">SPEAKER 1: She said something unintelligible, but what she probably said is, that this looks</span> <span m="1209750">like a pattern that might match with the heuristic transformation A, right? Because we have a</span> <span m="1217029">function in which the variable is buried, universally in sines, or cosines, or tangents,</span> <span m="1222320">or cotangents, or secants, or cosecants. And we know we can rewrite that in one of three</span> <span m="1227649">ways. It's already written as a function of sine and cosine. But we can also rewrite that</span> <span m="1235549">in terms of tangent and cosecant. Or cotangent and secant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1241809">So when we do that, we can go this way, and we can get the integral of 1 over the cotangent</span> <span m="1250370">of x dx. That's g3 up there. Or we can do it down this path, and get the integral of</span> <span m="1263120">tangent of x dx. And of course, those are both to the fourth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1271200">But know what, I've broken my little graphical diagram again. Where did it go, it's disappeared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1283140">There it is. How have I broken it? Because with transformation A, I've introduced a possibility</span> <span m="1295110">that a particular problem can be transformed into more than one kind of problem, any of</span> <span m="1299220">which will be the solution to my problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1303470">So far I've got an and node, but now I've got to introduce an or node. Because now we</span> <span m="1320740">have an example of something that can be solved one of two different ways, and we don't care</span> <span m="1324210">which one it is. Now you'll notice that there's already some confusion here, because how can</span> <span m="1330399">you tell the difference between an and node and an or node. So the universal convention</span> <span m="1333970">is, you draw an arc over the and nodes. And that makes it look like an A, so it's easy</span> <span m="1340190">to remember. So those are and nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1342850">And now, we have the method of problem reduction, and this is sometimes called a problem reduction</span> <span m="1350200">tree. Sometimes it's called an and/or tree, and sometimes it's called a goal tree, because</span> <span m="1365750">this tree of problems is a tree that shows how our goals are related to one another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1373100">So these are items for your vocabulary that are all synonymous. Problem reduction tree,</span> <span m="1377809">and/or tree, goal tree, all the same thing. Now you have a name for it, you've got some</span> <span m="1382200">power over it. So when we get a situation like this, unlike the previous situation,</span> <span m="1391279">which we suggested might come up in transformation A. Let's see, we've got one, two, C, and this</span> <span m="1411880">one is A, it's an or node. Which one of these problems do we work on?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1420010">Well Slegle, who considered himself to be modeling a freshman, modeling the intelligence</span> <span m="1425360">of a freshman, modeling something that, after all, you have to be pretty smart to do, right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1432200">Most people don't know how to do integration. Everybody at MIT knows how to do integration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1437460">You would think that somebody, therefore, that knows how to do integration is pretty</span> <span m="1440100">smart. What would a smart person do, when faced with this choice?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443980">Well, a smart person would say, which of these two problems is easier? So how do you think</span> <span m="1452669">you might determine which of two, or many algebraic expressions is the easiest to integrate?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1461800">What's your name?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1462960">AUDIENCE: Andrew Carrol.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1464120">SPEAKER 1: Andrew, what do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466500">AUDIENCE: Based on whichever one feels more familiar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1468039">SPEAKER 1: Feels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470010">AUDIENCE: Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1471809">SPEAKER 1: Feels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472340">AUDIENCE: You asked, how would I decide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472570">SPEAKER 1: Yeah, how would you decide? How would you feel it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1474760">AUDIENCE: I would feel that the tangent is more familiar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1477990">SPEAKER 1: Which one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1479679">AUDIENCE: I feel that the tangent [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1482850">SPEAKER 1: Yeah, but I wonder how we could make it a little bit more precise, this idea</span> <span m="1484409">of simplicity. The young Turk has a suggestion. What?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1492349">AUDIENCE: I had a suggestion until you said this idea of simplicity. So then I realized</span> <span m="1497969">that what I was about to suggest wasn't going to clarify simplicity, but I was going to</span> <span m="1502909">say, whichever one we've had more encounters with, or more experience with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509289">SPEAKER 1: Yeah, if there was something here with a hyperbolic tangent, you might say,</span> <span m="1512419">well, stay away from that. [? Yinid ?]?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1515950">AUDIENCE: To which one of those the easier transformation is applied on the next step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521399">SPEAKER 1: Like, somebody do a little look ahead, and see which kind of thing would be</span> <span m="1524820">next to you? I don't know, maybe. Oh, we've got lots of people, all at the same time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1529640">I don't know all your names yet. Shoot. Erica, I know you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533200">AUDIENCE: What's look it up in the table and see [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535840">SPEAKER 1: Oh, you could look it up in the table and see if something is in it, you could</span> <span m="1540300">do that. But this is tangent to the fourth, so that's not in the table. Ariel?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546840">AUDIENCE: I choose the one without the reciprocal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549620">SPEAKER 1: Why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550800">AUDIENCE: It is because when people see one it's like, oh man, it jut not going to work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1557740">SPEAKER 1: Yeah, we're on the right track. Claire?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1560120">AUDIENCE: On an extremely simple level, I choose whichever one has the least symbols</span> <span m="1563480">in it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1564680">SPEAKER 1: The fewest symbols in it. Now we're really getting somewhere, because you can</span> <span m="1567060">measure that, right, there's a little program Why Brett, there you are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1572640">AUDIENCE: I would say, every [INAUDIBLE] expression can be written as, having a number of functions,</span> <span m="1579800">we could say all these functions, multiplied together, divided, and you can just choose</span> <span m="1583500">with the least amount of [? iterations ?].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1586980">SPEAKER 1: Well I heard it, perhaps others didn't but what Brett said, is he suggested</span> <span m="1591769">that we should measure depth of functional composition. So the number of symbols may</span> <span m="1598040">not matter, because if you have x plus x plus x plus x, out to a hundred, that would not</span> <span m="1602779">be hard to integrate. But if you've got something that is really deeply nested under a lot of</span> <span m="1609620">functional compositions, that could be a problem. And that's in fact, what Slegle decided to</span> <span m="1614860">use, after trying several alternatives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1620440">So if we measure the depth of the functional composition, this is the winner, and we put</span> <span m="1626370">the other one on the shelf, at least for the moment. And now we have tangent to the fourth</span> <span m="1631399">x dx. Do I need the safe transformation supply? No. Which of the-- you know something has</span> <span m="1638809">to apply, otherwise it wouldn't be up here as an example. So what of the heuristic transformation</span> <span m="1644440">supply? Elliott.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1645289">AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1646460">SPEAKER 1: Yeah, B bravo. Military background or something like that. Maybe</span> <span m="1650240">he flies airplanes. OK so B says, it is in fact a function of the tangent. And when we</span> <span m="1658169">do that, we've got to make a substitution, that y is equal to the tangent. So that means</span> <span m="1663529">that this becomes the integral of y to the fourth over 1 plus y squared. And that's by</span> <span m="1675799">transformation B, and the transformation is y equals tangent of x. The tangent-- I guess</span> <span m="1688059">I've lost track of the fact that I've already transformed a y, but relabeling doesn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1697450">All right so that's progress, maybe. But don't see this in any of the heuristic transformations,</span> <span m="1705769">what do I do now? I didn't have to look in the heuristic transformations, because one</span> <span m="1710340">of the safe transformations applies. Because this thing is a rational function and the</span> <span m="1719370">degree of the numerator is greater that the degree of the denominator, so I have to divide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724120">And when I divide, and that by the way is number four, I get what? Is anybody good high</span> <span m="1732240">school algebra that can help me out with that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1733960">AUDIENCE: Y squared minus 2 plus negative 2 over 1 plus y squared</span> <span m="1739740">SPEAKER 1: Exactly, y squared minus 1 plus 1 over 1 plus y squared, I think. Now what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755679">Now we're really getting close to getting through this, because that is a sum. And by</span> <span m="1771009">virtue of the fact that it's a sum, that divides into three pieces, and the top piece is the</span> <span m="1778070">integral of y squared, the middle piece is the integral of minus 1, and the bottom piece</span> <span m="1784399">is the integral of 1 over 1 plus y squared dy in all cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1791929">Gosh, if I look this up, I've found it. That's up there, that's letter B. So I'm done with</span> <span m="1806929">that. This one I can transform again, by virtue of 1, and now I get the integral dy. That's</span> <span m="1816409">in there, that's B as well. As this one, I don't know. But I'd better keep track of what</span> <span m="1824750">I'm doing here. This is in the and node, so I've got to do all of those. I can't give</span> <span m="1827669">up on that last thing. And that and transformation is transformation number 3. So this is in</span> <span m="1838139">the table, this is in the table, we still have this to do, but that's C, heuristic transformation</span> <span m="1846710">C. We have 1, plus y squared, then with the transformation C, with y-- this is y squared--</span> <span m="1858659">y equals tangent of z And then we get to the integral of dz and that's in the table and,</span> <span m="1869149">we're done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1870889">So now we've solved the problem. It's the hardest problem that appeared in that half</span> <span m="1876120">decade on MIT 18 01 finals. This is exactly the problem that was given, except that it</span> <span m="1884009">started here. I put the other two pieces on just to illustrate a couple of the transformations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1890080">But that's a problem that it solved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1895480">And now that we've seen an example, we can finish up what we talked about a little bit</span> <span m="1902320">ago, having to do with the architecture of this thing. So far, all we've done is talk</span> <span m="1911779">about the safe transformations, but now we know that if we're not done, we need to find</span> <span m="1918040">a problem to work on</span> <span m="1926860">using that depth of functional composition business. And then after that we apply heuristic</span> <span m="1937159">transformation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1948820">And the way Slagle designed his program is,</span> <span m="1951540">he found just one problem to work on, did one transformation,</span> <span m="1954610">then went back around the loop. Because these heuristic transformations are a little harder</span> <span m="1958600">to apply than the safe ones. So I'll given you an accurate portrayal of what this program</span> <span m="1964679">did, except for one thing. Which I would like, now, to go back and patch up. And that thing</span> <span m="1971169">is over here. What to do with something like this. Well we got to that in a board that's</span> <span m="1989009">disappeared, but when we tried to deal with this, we had to find a heuristic transformation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1995350">And when we decided to work on this, it must have been the case that this was the simplest</span> <span m="2000289">problem at a leaf node that has not yet been solved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2004370">So what's the functional composition depth of this? It's 3. Back over here, we have something</span> <span m="2012559">that has a depth of functional composition of 2. So when the program actually ran on</span> <span m="2017649">this particular problem, it stopped a few inches short of the finish line, And went</span> <span m="2024029">back and screwed around with that other problem for a little bit, before it gave up and came</span> <span m="2028720">back here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2030919">So it's always looking across the whole tree, the leaves of the tree. Whenever it has to</span> <span m="2035669">find a place to work on with the heuristic transformation, it happened to look at all</span> <span m="2039970">the leaves of the tree that had not yet been dealt with, tried to find the easiest one,</span> <span m="2044159">and that could involve a lot of backing up and starting over on a branch of the tree</span> <span m="2048550">that it had previously ignored. A small detail, not a particularly important one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2054710">Now where are we. We've got that guy there. We've got our complete architecture. We've</span> <span m="2075620">got our solved problem. And now we can start reflecting on what we've done. We can say,</span> <span m="2084300">for example, how good an integration program is this? And the answer is, it was pretty</span> <span m="2089900">good. This machine that Slagle was using was a machine that was over in building 26. And</span> <span m="2097970">we were so proud of it, that it was behind glass, and you could go there and watch the</span> <span m="2101900">tape spin, it was really a delight. 32k of memory, that's 32k of memory. It's amazing</span> <span m="2110610">that he was able to do anything with a machine of that size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2117440">Let's see, let's get us a clean one. Can't do board geometry and talk at the same</span> <span m="2129740">time. We can now ask some questions about how well the program performed. It was given</span> <span m="2140220">56 of the hardest problems, and it got 54 right. What happened when it didn't get the</span> <span m="2149000">other two? Well, you might be right if you said, oh it probably ran out of memory, since</span> <span m="2155310">it had 32k. But in fact, it just was lacking 2 transformations that were needed, in order</span> <span m="2161280">to solve the whole entire set of final quiz problems. So when a program fails, that's</span> <span m="2169930">often the most interesting question you can ask. This is an exception. This failed for</span> <span m="2175270">uninteresting reasons on 2 of the 56 problems that it was given to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180670">And now the next question you can say is, what is the depth of the tree in the maximal</span> <span m="2190750">case? And the answer is, it's that case we just worked out. And since I've once again</span> <span m="2196370">lost the whole tree, I'll tell you that it's depth was 7 when you take off that minus 5.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2202880">So in the worst case, this thing had to get down seven levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2211090">That's the worst case, a more interesting question is what was the average depth? And</span> <span m="2220380">that was approximately 3. And now we're beginning to say something, not only about Slagle's</span> <span m="2229900">model of how a freshman works, but we're beginning to say something about the nature of the domain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236450">In the domain of calculus problems, integrals expressions that are given to freshman, in</span> <span m="2241980">that domain, the average depth of problem reduction needed to solve the problem was</span> <span m="2249670">3. So that's not very complicated. If it were 10, you would say, wow, how can anybody ever</span> <span m="2255270">do those problems? If it were 5, you'd say, well only people destined to be math professors</span> <span m="2262260">are going to get anything right. If it's 3, us ordinary mortals can do a pretty good job.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2268590">Another question of even greater interest is, how many branches were unused? Here's</span> <span m="2286040">a branch that turned out to be unused, it didn't pursue that. And so you might say,</span> <span m="2290910">well maybe there are a lot of unused branches. Maybe you have to be pretty smart about your</span> <span m="2297850">method for determining what problem to work on, because otherwise you'll go down a lot</span> <span m="2301160">of rat holes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2303580">And guess what, here's another statement about the domain. In the domain of problems that</span> <span m="2310250">freshmen could work on a final, the number of unused branches is about 1. So that means</span> <span m="2318060">this tree keeps itself together, and doesn't run down to a very large, bushy, useless tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2325690">So this means that the depth of functional composition, which Brett suggested as a technique</span> <span m="2332320">for recognizing the right problem work on, was a choice that didn't actually matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2339750">Because the tree doesn't grow deep, it doesn't go broad. It doesn't matter what you use to</span> <span m="2345710">decide what to work on, because in the worst case, you'll just generate a couple of extra,</span> <span m="2350110">useless nodes. But they very quickly run to find a dead end, so you don't have to do anything</span> <span m="2354150">more with them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2359020">So now the next thing we need to do is back even further away from this program, and ask</span> <span m="2364280">ourselves some questions about the nature of what we've been doing. And that brings</span> <span m="2369370">me to the things I've got on that upper right-hand board. One of those things as a catechism</span> <span m="2374170">having to do with knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2377020">And what we've done informally as we went through this program was, we've asked questions</span> <span m="2381050">such as, what kind of knowledge is involved in doing this? Well knowledge about transformation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2388530">Knowledge about how goal trees work and when we're done with a problem. Knowledge about</span> <span m="2394770">what things don't need to be transformed, because you can look them up in a table. That's</span> <span m="2399520">the kind of knowledge that is involved in doing 18 01. And if you do 18 0 circuit theory,</span> <span m="2405890">6 0 circuit theory or 6 0 Maxwell's equations, this is the same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2411020">You have to ask questions of this sort,</span> <span m="2414030">about the nature of the knowledge involved, and question number one is always, what kind</span> <span m="2417430">of knowledge is involved? Is it Kirchhoff's laws, Maxwell's equations, what is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2423440">The next question is, how is the knowledge represented? And our answers here are, well</span> <span m="2427440">all this stuff, ultimately was represented in list best expressions. Some of the</span> <span m="2432700">knowledge was recorded in a table [? of best ?] expressions to show what transformations</span> <span m="2437040">there are. There was a similar table of integrals. Knowledge about goal trees was embedded in</span> <span m="2443930">the procedure, so it was procedurally represented. And so for each of the categories of knowledge,</span> <span m="2449970">there's a way it gets represented. How is it used? Straightforward, transformations</span> <span m="2456550">are used to make the problem simpler. The table is used to trim off and to serve as</span> <span m="2462390">the bottom of the tree. Those are the ways in which the knowledge is used.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2466530">And then there's the question of course of, how much knowledge is required. Something</span> <span m="2473440">that's useful to know if it's late at night, you have 2 finals the next day, and you're</span> <span m="2479180">not sure which course you should study. So how much knowledge might you suppose was actually</span> <span m="2484640">in this program? I've shown you a glimpse of the kind of knowledge that's involved in</span> <span m="2489960">the program. I've answered a little bit of question 5, what exactly. But how much knowledge</span> <span m="2494710">was involved. You might be surprised by the answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2496910">First of all, the table of integrals. I've listed only 3 things there. There are lots</span> <span m="2504540">of other things you can think of, like integral of e to the x is e to the x. But in the end,</span> <span m="2510770">what Slagle found is, a table only 26 elements was enough to solve all of these problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2518310">How about the transformations here, the safe ones, about 12. How about the heuristic ones,</span> <span m="2531320">about 12. So just a few bits and pieces of knowledge, here and there, are sufficient</span> <span m="2537490">to do everything you need to do, in order to do the integration problems on a calculus</span> <span m="2542370">final. That was a surprise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545520">Another surprise of a similar kind, also about knowledge, is that the relationship between</span> <span m="2551140">the method to be used, and the characteristics of the problem, was almost a diagonal table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2560400">That means that you could, in this domain, make the right transformation almost all the</span> <span m="2566850">time if you're a little bit smart, and never back up. That was an observation made by Joel</span> <span m="2572300">Moses, who became subsequently our provost here at MIT for a while. And he wrote a program</span> <span m="2578210">that could solve anything. It would beat the most dedicated mathematicians at integration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2585760">And its descendents are in MATLAB today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2588610">But this is how it all works. And now you can write one of these things yourself. Partly</span> <span m="2592570">because you now have this catechism. This is the kind of stuff you should ask any time</span> <span m="2598300">you're dealing with a new domain. It will make you smarter. And this is of course, meta</span> <span m="2604320">knowledge, this is knowledge about knowledge. So this tired aphorism isn't quite what we</span> <span m="2610970">are going to complete ourselves with. We're going to say that knowledge about knowledge</span> <span m="2623810">is where the real power is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625850">Now there's one final thing that this program does for us. It tells us something about our</span> <span m="2632790">appreciation of what it means to be intelligent. You know that in the beginning of this hour,</span> <span m="2638280">I asked you to think about whether a program that could do symbolic integration would be,</span> <span m="2644260">in any way, or should be considered to any degree, intelligent. And I'm imagining that</span> <span m="2652480">even in these days of MATLAB, and whatnot, many of you said well, yes, I learned how</span> <span m="2657820">to do that at MIT, or late in high school, so it must be smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2663190">But now that we've completed this discussion, I also expect that your feeling of intelligence</span> <span m="2669410">in this program is somewhat diminished. Because what happens is that, when we understand how</span> <span m="2674740">something works, it's intelligence seems to vanish. You've seen this in your friends,</span> <span m="2679890">right? They solve some problem, they seem super smart. Then they tell you how they did</span> <span m="2686740">it, and they don't seem so smart anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2690830">So let's conclude our discussion today was a little story. A long time ago I was talking</span> <span m="2699860">with a student who said, computers cannot be intelligent. And I said, OK, maybe you're</span> <span m="2708030">right, but let me show you this program. So I showed him the integration program, working</span> <span m="2712100">on problems like this. And after I showed him a couple of those examples, he says, well,</span> <span m="2718580">all right, I guess maybe they can be intelligent. I'm learning how to do that, and it's not</span> <span m="2723460">always easy. Then I made a fatal mistake. I said let me show you how it works, and we</span> <span m="2730830">spent an hour going through it like this. And at the end of that time, he turned to</span> <span m="2735280">me and said, I take it back, it's not intelligent after all. It does integration the same way</span> <span m="2742050">I do.</span> </p>

<p><span m="9234">PATRICK WINSTON: So where are we?</span> </p>
<p><span m="10300">We started off with simple methods for learning stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="14962">Then, we talked a little about a purchase of learning that</span> <span m="20730">we're vaguely inspired by.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24556">The fact that our heads are stuffed with neurons, and that</span> <span m="27300">we seemed to have evolved from primates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="31095">Then, we talked about looking at the problem and address the</span> <span m="34940">issue of [? phrenology ?]</span> <span m="36410">and how it's possible to learn concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="40430">But now, we're coming full circle back to the beginning</span> <span m="43700">and thinking about how to divide up a space with</span> <span m="47990">decision boundaries.</span> </p>
<p><span m="49930">But whereas, you do it with a neural net or a nearest</span> <span m="54580">neighbors or a ID tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="56510">Those are very simple ideas that work very often.</span> </p>
<p><span m="62115">Today, we're going to talk about a very sophisticated</span> <span m="65895">idea that still has a implementation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69212">So this needs to be in the tool bag of</span> <span m="73220">every civilized person.</span> </p>
<p><span m="75506">This is about support vector machines, an</span> <span m="78560">idea that was developed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="80735">Well, I want to talk to you today about how</span> <span m="82470">ideas develop, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="84705">Because you look at stuff like this in a book, and you think,</span> <span m="87150">well, Vladimir Vapnik just figured this out one Saturday</span> <span m="92515">afternoon when the weather was too bad to go outside.</span> </p>
<p><span m="95780">That's not how it happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="97185">It happens very differently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="98580">I want to talk to you a little about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="101229">The next thing about great things that were done by</span> <span m="106950">people who are still alive is you can ask them</span> <span m="109060">how they did it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="110210">You can't do that with Fourier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="111810">You can't say to Fourier, how did you do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="114310">Did you dream it up on a Saturday afternoon?</span> </p>
<p><span m="116946">But can call Vapnik on the phone and ask him questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120220">That's the stuff I'm going to talk about toward</span> <span m="122050">the end of the hour.</span> </p>
<p><span m="124186">Well, it's all about decision boundaries.</span> </p>
<p><span m="126045">And now, we have several techniques that we can use to</span> <span m="131400">draw some decision boundaries.</span> </p>
<p><span m="132620">And here's the same problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="134700">And if we drew decision boundaries in here, we might</span> <span m="138329">get something that would look like maybe this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="141826">If we were doing a nearest neighbor approach, and if</span> <span m="145790">we're doing ID trees, we'll just draw in a line like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="151522">And if we're doing neural nets, well, you can put in a</span> <span m="154945">lot of straight lines wherever you like with a neural net,</span> <span m="157550">depending on how it's trained up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="159110">Or if you just simply go in there and design it, so you</span> <span m="162470">could do that if you wanted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="165554">And you would think that after people have been working on</span> <span m="168110">this sort of stuff for 50 or 75 years that there wouldn't</span> <span m="172500">be any tricks in the bag left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174535">And that's when everybody got surprised, because around the</span> <span m="179340">early '90s Vladimir Vapnik introduced the ideas I'm about</span> <span m="183880">to talk to you about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="185916">So what Vapnik says is something like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="191215">Here you have a space, and you have some negative examples,</span> <span m="197470">and you have some positive examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="200436">How do you divide the positive examples from</span> <span m="202870">the negative examples?</span> </p>
<p><span m="204220">And what he says that we want to do is we want to draw a</span> <span m="207710">straight line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="209140">But which straight line is the question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="212062">Well, we want to draw a straight line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="215140">Well, would this be a good straight line?</span> </p>
<p><span m="218141">One that went up like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="220492">Probably not so hot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="222660">How about one that's just right here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="225622">Well, that might separate them, but it seems awfully</span> <span m="229460">close to the negative examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="231765">So maybe what we ought to do is we ought to draw our</span> <span m="235030">straight line in here, sort of like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="240458">And that line is drawn with a view toward putting in the</span> <span m="247590">widest street that separates the positive samples from the</span> <span m="253330">negative samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="254460">That's why I call it the widest street approach.</span> </p>
<p><span m="257209">So that makes way of putting in the decision boundary--</span> <span m="261535">is to put in a straight line but in contrast with the way</span> <span m="265560">ID tree puts in a straight line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="267440">It tries to put the line in in such a way as the separation</span> <span m="272165">between the positive and negative examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="274680">That street is as wide as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="277236">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="277722">So you might think to do that in the UROP project, and then,</span> <span m="281620">let it go with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="283205">What's the big deal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="284730">So what we've got to do is we've got to go through why</span> <span m="287340">it's a big deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="289176">So first of all, we like to think about how you would make</span> <span m="295170">a decision rule that would use that decision boundary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="299326">So what I'm going to ask you to imagine is that we've got a</span> <span m="303650">vector of any length that you like, constrained to be</span> <span m="309650">perpendicular to the median, or if you like, perpendicular</span> <span m="313715">to the gutters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="314630">It's perpendicular to the median line of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="318280">All right, it's drawn in such a way that that's true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="320540">We don't know anything about it's length, yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323984">Then, we also have some unknown, say, right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="329920">And we have a vector that points to it by excel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="335325">So now, what we're really interested in is whether or</span> <span m="339310">not that unknown is on the right side of the street or on</span> <span m="342920">the left side of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="345062">So what we'd what to do is want to project that vector,</span> <span m="347909">u, down on to one that's perpendicular to the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="351990">Because then, we'll have the distance in this direction or</span> <span m="355205">a number that's proportional to this in this direction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="358490">And the further out we go, the closer we'll get to being on</span> <span m="362670">the right side of the street, where the right side of the</span> <span m="365360">street is not the correct side but actually the right side of</span> <span m="368065">the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="368985">So what we can do is we can say, let's take w and dot it</span> <span m="374280">with u and measure whether or not that number is equal to or</span> <span m="379930">greater than some constant, c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="382646">So remember that the dot product has taken the</span> <span m="385880">projection onto w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="387896">And the bigger that projection is, the further out along this</span> <span m="392150">line the projection will lie.</span> </p>
<p><span m="394255">And eventually it will be so big that the projection</span> <span m="397490">crosses the median line of the street, and we'll say it must</span> <span m="400440">be a positive sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="405707">Or we could say, without loss of generality that the dot</span> <span m="410880">product plus some constant, b, is equal to or greater than 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416360">If that's true, then it's a positive sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423050">So that's our decision rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431522">And this is the first in several elements that we're</span> <span m="437300">going to have to line up to understand this idea called</span> <span m="440960">support vector machines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="443340">So that's the decision rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="444730">And the trouble is we don't know what constant to use, and</span> <span m="449460">we don't know which w to use either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="452450">We know that w has to be perpendicular to the median</span> <span m="455390">line of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="457476">But there's lot of w's that are perpendicular to the</span> <span m="459880">median line of the street, because it</span> <span m="461070">could be of any length.</span> </p>
<p><span m="462740">So we don't have enough constraint here to fix a</span> <span m="465750">particular b or a particular w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="469532">Are you with me so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="472395">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="475176">And this, by the way, we get just by saying that c</span> <span m="477990">equals minus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="482800">What we're going to do next is we're going to lay on some</span> <span m="485790">additional constraints whether you're toward putting enough</span> <span m="488960">constraint on the situation that we can actually calculate</span> <span m="493330">a b and a w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="496015">So what we're going to say is this, that if we look at this</span> <span m="501290">quantity that we're checking out to be greater than or less</span> <span m="504680">than 0 to make our decision, then, what we're going to do</span> <span m="508040">is we're going to say that if we take that vector w, and we</span> <span m="512510">take the dot product of that with some x plus, some</span> <span m="517789">positive sample, now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="518929">This is not an unknown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="519760">This is a positive sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522272">If we take the dot product of those two vectors, and we had</span> <span m="526500">b just like in our decision rule, we're going to want that</span> <span m="530050">to be equal to or greater than 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="534220">So in other words, you can be an unknown anywhere in this</span> <span m="539080">street and be just a little bit greater or just a little</span> <span m="542140">bit less than 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="543610">But if you're a positive sample, we're going to insist</span> <span m="546120">that this decision function gives the</span> <span m="548550">value of one or greater.</span> </p>
<p><span m="551476">Likewise, if w thought it was some negative sample is</span> <span m="561030">provided to us, then we're going to say that has to be</span> <span m="564380">equal to or less than minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="568690">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="569866">So if you're a minus sample, like one of these two guys or</span> <span m="573790">any minus sample that may lie down here, this function that</span> <span m="578330">gives us the decision rule must return minus 1 or less.</span> </p>
<p><span m="582506">So there's a separation of distance here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="585020">Minus 1 to plus 1 for all of the samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="590717">So that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="592842">But we're not quite done, because carrying around two</span> <span m="598290">equations like this, it's a pain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="601534">So what we're going to do is we're going to introduce</span> <span m="604760">another variable to make like a little easier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611502">Like many things that we do, and when we develop this kind</span> <span m="615210">of stuff, introducing this variable is not something that</span> <span m="619120">God says has to be done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="624380">What is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="625310">We introduced this additional stuff to do what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="628930">To make the mathematics more convenient, so mathematical</span> <span m="634140">convenience.</span> </p>
<p><span m="635822">So what we're going to do is we're going to introduce a</span> <span m="637730">variable, y sub i, such that y sub i is equal to plus 1 for</span> <span m="653600">plus samples and minus 1 for negative samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="670460">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="671685">So for each sample, we're going to have a value for this</span> <span m="674190">new quantity we've introduced, y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="676680">And the value of y is going to be determined by whether it's</span> <span m="679910">a positive sample or negative sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="682370">If it's a positive sample it's got to be plus 1 for this</span> <span m="686600">situation up here, and it's going to be minus 1 for this</span> <span m="689280">situation down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="691235">So what we're going to do with this first equation is we're</span> <span m="694480">going to multiply it by y sub i, and that is now x of i,</span> <span m="701605">plus b is equal to or greater than 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="706430">And then, you know what we're going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="707740">We're going to multiply the left side of this equation by</span> <span m="713030">y sub i, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="714770">So the second equation becomes y sub i times x sub i plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="723172">And now, what does that do over here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="725876">We multiplied this guy times minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="729480">So it used to be the case that that was less than minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="732750">So if we multiply it by minus 1, then it has to be greater</span> <span m="734900">than plus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738990">The two equations are the same, because that introduces</span> <span m="743220">this little mathematical convenience.</span> </p>
<p><span m="746580">So now, we can say that y sub i times x sub i plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="757986">Well, what we're going to do--</span> <span m="761826">Brett?</span> </p>
<p><span m="762675">STUDENT: What happened to the w?</span> </p>
<p><span m="764255">PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, did I leave out a w?</span> </p>
<p><span m="765450">I'm sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="766050">Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="768612">Yeah, I wouldn't have gotten very far with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="771561">So that's dot it with w, dot it with w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774210">Thank you, Brett.</span> </p>
<p><span m="775605">Those are all vectors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="776710">I'll pretty soon forget to put the little vector marks on</span> <span m="780010">there, but you know what I mean.</span> </p>
<p><span m="781090">So that's w plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="785256">And now, let me bring that 1 over to the left side, and</span> <span m="789660">that's equal to or greater than 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="793535">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794730">With Brett's correction, I think everything's OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797440">But we're going to take one more step, and we're going to</span> <span m="801010">say that y sub i times x sub i times w plus b minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="813885">It's always got to be equal to or greater than 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="815760">But what I'm going to say is if we're for</span> <span m="822492">x sub i in a gutter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829092">So there's always going to be greater than 0, but we're</span> <span m="831140">going to add the additional constraint that it's going to</span> <span m="833540">be exactly 0 for all the samples that end up in the</span> <span m="838300">gutters here of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="840190">So the value of that expression is going to be</span> <span m="843010">exactly 0 for that sample, 0 for this sample and this</span> <span m="848390">sample, not 0 for that sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="850460">It's got to be greater than 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852180">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="853846">So that's step number two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="865319">And this is step number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="871454">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="871950">So now, we've just got some expressions to talk about,</span> <span m="874340">some constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="876415">Now, what are we trying to do here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="877870">I forgot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="879922">Oh, I remember now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="881320">We're trying to figure out how to arrange for the line to be</span> <span m="885500">such at the street separating the pluses from the minuses as</span> <span m="888790">wide as possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="891121">So maybe we better figure out how we can express the</span> <span m="894300">distance between the two gutters.</span> </p>
<p><span m="903645">Let's just repeat our drawing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="906822">We've got some minuses here, got pluses out here, and we've</span> <span m="912030">got gutters that are going down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="917021">And now, we've got a vector here to a minus, and we've got</span> <span m="922290">a vector here to a plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927091">So we'll call that x plus and this x minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="933950">So what's the width of the street?</span> </p>
<p><span m="936730">I don't know, yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="937600">But what we can do is we can take the difference of those</span> <span m="940360">two vectors, and that will be a vector that</span> <span m="944120">looks like this, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="946346">So that's x plus minus x minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="952016">So now, if I only had a unit normal that's normal to the</span> <span m="956280">median line of the street, if it's a unit normal, then I</span> <span m="960320">could just take the dot product or that unit normal</span> <span m="962120">and this difference vector, and that would be the width of</span> <span m="963975">the street, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="965980">So in other words, if I had a unit vector in that direction,</span> <span m="973090">then I could just dot the two together, and that would be</span> <span m="975530">the width of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="977896">So let me write that down before I forget.</span> </p>
<p><span m="981550">So the width is equal to x plus minus x minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="991625">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="994396">That's the difference vector.</span> </p>
<p><span m="995580">And now, I've got to multiple it by unit vector.</span> </p>
<p><span m="997510">But wait a minute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998180">I said that that w is a normal, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1001590">The w is a normal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1004032">So what I can do is I can multiply this times w, and</span> <span m="1010018">then, we'll divide by the magnitude of w, and that will</span> <span m="1014156">make it a unit vector.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016591">So that dot product, not a product, that dot product is,</span> <span m="1025650">in fact, a scalar, and it's the width of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1030329">It doesn't do as much good, because it doesn't look like</span> <span m="1034730">we get much out of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037053">Oh, but I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1038220">Let's see, what can we get out of it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1041371">Oh gee, we've got this equation over here, this</span> <span m="1045954">equation that constrains the samples</span> <span m="1048594">that lie in the gutter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1051310">So if we have a positive sample, for example, then this</span> <span m="1055610">is plus 1, and we have this equation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1061150">So it says that x plus times w is equal to, oh, 1 minus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1078492">See, I'm just taking this part here, this vector here, and</span> <span m="1082210">I'm dotting it with x plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1084880">So that's this piece right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1088650">y is 1 for this kind of sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1091230">So I'll just take the 1 and the b back over to the other</span> <span m="1093600">side, and I've got 1 minus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1096212">OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1098592">Well, we can do the same trick with x minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1102241">If we've got a negative sample,</span> <span m="1104806">then y sub i is negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1108572">That gives us our negative w times dot over x sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1114296">But now, we take this stuff back over to the right side,</span> <span m="1117190">and we get 1 plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1125252">So that all licenses to rewrite this thing as 2 over</span> <span m="1130200">the magnitude of w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1132646">How did I get there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1134210">Well, I decided I was going to enforce this constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1139270">I noted that the width of the street has got to be this</span> <span m="1143540">difference vector times a unit vector.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1146105">Then, I used the constraint to plug back some values here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1149400">And I discovered to my delight and amazement that the width</span> <span m="1152480">of the street is 2 over the magnitude of w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1158340">Yes, Brett?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1160388">STUDENT: So your first x plus is minus b, and x</span> <span m="1163881">minus is 1 plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165378">PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1165877">STUDENT: So you're subtracting it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1166875">PATRICK WINSTON: Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1167750">If I've got a minus here, then that makes that minus, and</span> <span m="1171855">then, the b is minus, and when I take the b over to the other</span> <span m="1173810">side it becomes plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175579">STUDENT: Yeah, so if you subtract the left with the</span> <span m="1178573">right [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1181068">PATRICK WINSTON: No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1181670">No, sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1182320">This expression here is 1 plus b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1186981">Trust me it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1188870">I haven't got my legs all tangled up like last Friday,</span> <span m="1191370">well, not yet, anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1193786">It's possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1195340">There's going to be a lot of algebra here eventually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1198958">So this quantity here, this is miracle number three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1204995">This quantity here is the width of the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209731">And what we're trying to do is we're trying to</span> <span m="1213570">maximize that, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1217158">So we want to maximize 2 over the magnitude of w if we're to</span> <span m="1227170">get the widest street under the constraints that we've</span> <span m="1229300">decided that we're going to work with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1232210">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1233050">So that means that it's OK to maximize 1 over w, instead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1246281">We just drop the constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1248250">And that means that it's OK to minimize the</span> <span m="1253550">magnitude of w, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1259572">And that means that it's OK to minimize 1/2 times the</span> <span m="1268710">magnitude of w squared.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1272070">Right, Brett?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273675">Why did I do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276075">Why did I multiply by 1/2 and square it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1279010">STUDENT: Because it's mathematically convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1279970">PATRICK WINSTON: It's mathematically convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1280930">Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282850">So this is point number three in the development.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1287840">So where do we go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1288950">We decided that was going to be our decision rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1291170">We're going to see which side of the line we're on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1293530">We decided to constrain the situation, so the value of the</span> <span m="1296420">decision rule is plus 1 in the gutters for the positive</span> <span m="1300750">samples and minus 1 in the gutters for</span> <span m="1302820">the negative samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1304070">And then, we discovered that maximizing the width of the</span> <span m="1307470">street led us to an expression like that,</span> <span m="1311090">which we wish to maximize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1317425">Should we take a break?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1318350">Should we get coffee?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1319460">Too bad, we can't do that in this kind of situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1322365">But we would if we could.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1324400">And I'm sure when Vapnik got to this point, he</span> <span m="1327090">went out for coffee.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1329826">So now, we back up, and we say, well, let's let these</span> <span m="1333820">expressions start developing into a song.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1337252">Not like that, that's vapid, speaking of Vapnik.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1349760">What song is it going to sing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1351970">We've got an expression here that we'd like to find the</span> <span m="1355680">minimum of, the extremum of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1358236">And we've got some constraints here that we</span> <span m="1361790">would like to honor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1364040">What are we going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1367600">Let me put what we're going to do to you in</span> <span m="1369300">the form of a puzzle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1372385">Is it got something to do with Legendre?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1378900">Has it got something to do with Laplace?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384270">Or does it have something to do with Lagrange?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387375">She says Lagrange.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389400">Actually, all three were said to be on Fourier's Doctoral</span> <span m="1392850">Defense Committee-- must have been quite an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395590">But we want to talk about Lagrange, because we've got a</span> <span m="1398960">situation here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1400605">Is this 1801?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402060">1802?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402840">1802.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1405000">We learned in 1802 that if we going to find the extremum of</span> <span m="1408462">a function with constraints, then we're going to have to</span> <span m="1413840">use Lagrange multipliers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415922">That would give us a new expression, which we can</span> <span m="1419820">maximize or minimize without thinking about</span> <span m="1423350">the constraints anymore.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1425090">That's how Lagrange multipliers work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1427755">So this brings us to miracle number four, developmental</span> <span m="1432440">piece number four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1433770">And it works like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1436420">We're going to say that L--</span> <span m="1438210">the thing we're going to try to maximize in order to</span> <span m="1440720">maximize the width of the street--</span> <span m="1442660">is equal to 1/2 times the magnitude of that vector, w,</span> <span m="1448235">squared minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452476">And now, we've got to have a summation over all the</span> <span m="1456230">constraints.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1458880">And each or those constraints is going to have a multiplier,</span> <span m="1461460">alpha sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1463412">And then, we write down the constraint.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466106">And when we write down a constraint,</span> <span m="1467575">there it is up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1469100">And I've got to be hyper careful here, because,</span> <span m="1471690">otherwise, I'll get lost in the algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1473830">So the constraint is y sub i times vector, w, dotted with</span> <span m="1482520">vector x sub i plus b, and now, I've got a closing</span> <span m="1489030">parenthesis, a minus 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1492315">That's the end of my constraint, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1500330">I sure hope I've got that right, because I'll be in deep</span> <span m="1503380">trouble if that's wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1504730">Anybody see any bugs in that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1505940">That looks right. doesn't it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1508250">We've got the original thing we're trying to work with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1510310">Now, we've got Lagrange multipliers all multiplied.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514425">It's back to that constraint up there, where each</span> <span m="1516300">constraint is constrained to be 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1520512">Well, there's a little bit of mathematical slight of hand</span> <span m="1524770">here, because in the end, the ones that are going to be 0,</span> <span m="1527810">the Lagrange multipliers here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1531210">The ones that are going to be non 0 are going to be the ones</span> <span m="1533795">connected with vectors that lie in the gutter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1536120">The rest are going to be 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1539848">But in any event, we can pretend that this is what</span> <span m="1543380">we're doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546550">I don't care whether it's a maximum or minimum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1548350">I've lost track.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549550">But what we're going to do is we're going to try to find an</span> <span m="1551290">extremum of that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1552360">So what do we do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1553730">What does 1801 teach us about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1558330">Finding the maximum--</span> <span m="1559465">well, we've got to find the derivatives and set them to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1564760">And then, after we've done that, a little bit of that</span> <span m="1566500">manipulation, we're going to see a wonderful</span> <span m="1568760">song start to emerge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570850">So let's see if we can do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1572890">Let's take the partial of L, the Lagrangian, with respect</span> <span m="1577160">to the vector, w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1579190">Oh my God, how do you differentiate with</span> <span m="1581430">respect to a vector?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1585255">It turns out that it has a form that looks exactly like</span> <span m="1588050">differentiating with respect to a scalar.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1590450">And the way you prove that to yourself is you just expand</span> <span m="1592580">everything in terms of all of the vector's components.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1595530">You differentiate those with respect to what you're</span> <span m="1597660">differentiating with respect to, and everything</span> <span m="1600140">turns out the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602380">So what you get when you differentiate this with</span> <span m="1604880">respect to the vector, w, is 2 comes down, and we have just</span> <span m="1612280">magnitude of w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1613833">Was it the magnitude of w?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1616090">Yeah, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1621629">Was it the magnitude of w?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1622910">Oh, it's not the magnitude of w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1626510">It's just w, like so, no magnitude involved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632396">Then, we've got a w over here, so we've got to differentiate</span> <span m="1636480">this part with respect to w, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1638270">But that part's a lot easier, because all we</span> <span m="1639690">have there is a w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1641310">There's no magnitude.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1642350">It's not raised to any power.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1644002">So what's w multiplied by?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1646290">Well, it's multiplied by x and y sub i and alpha sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1651954">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1652610">So that means that this expression, this derivative of</span> <span m="1656605">the Lagrangian, with respect to w is going to be equal to w</span> <span m="1661660">minus the sum of alpha sub i, y sub i, x sub i, and that's</span> <span m="1671820">got to be set to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1674240">And that implies that w is equal to the sum of some alpha</span> <span m="1682250">i, some scalars, times this minus 1 or plus 1 variable</span> <span m="1686980">times x sub i over i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1691332">And now, the math is beginning to sing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1694430">Because it tells us that the vector w is a linear sum of</span> <span m="1699490">the samples, all the samples or some of the sample.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1704492">It didn't have to be that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1707786">It could have been raised to a power.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1709230">It could have been a logarithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1711160">All sorts of horrible things could have</span> <span m="1713010">happened when we did this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1714320">But when we did this, we discovered that w is going to</span> <span m="1719210">be equal to a linear some of these vectors here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724620">Some of the vectors in the sample set, and I say some,</span> <span m="1729060">because for some alpha will be 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1734265">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1735515">So this is something that we want to take note of as</span> <span m="1741560">something important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1745402">Now, of course, we've got to differentiate L with respect</span> <span m="1749760">to anything else it might vary, so we've got to</span> <span m="1752900">differentiate L with respect to b, as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1758436">So what's that going to be equal to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1761222">Well, there's no b in here, so that makes no contribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1765705">This part here doesn't have a b in it, so that makes no</span> <span m="1768750">contribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1769335">There's no b over here, so that makes no contribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1772270">So we've got alpha i times y sub i times b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1777210">That has a contribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1779365">So that's going to be the sum of alpha i times y sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1786470">And then, we're differentiating with respect</span> <span m="1788570">to b, so that disappears.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1790635">There's a minus sign here, and that's equal to 0, or that</span> <span m="1795440">implies that the sum of the alpha i times y sub</span> <span m="1799490">i is equal to 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1803012">Hm, that looks like that might be helpful somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1810460">And now, it's time for more coffee.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1812755">By the way, these coffee periods take months.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815520">You stare at it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1816905">You work on something else.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818980">You've got to worry about your finals.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1822000">And you think about it some more.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824020">And eventually, you come back from coffee</span> <span m="1825740">and do the next thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1828930">Oh, what is the next thing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1831640">Well, we've still got this expression that we're trying</span> <span m="1834180">to find the minimum for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1841020">And you say to yourself, this is really a job for the</span> <span m="1843500">numerical analysts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1844480">Those guys know about this sort of stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1847205">Because of that little power in there, that square.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1849620">This is a so-called quadratic optimization problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1854772">So at this point, you would be inclined to hand this problem</span> <span m="1857480">over to a numerical analysts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1859290">They'll come back in a few weeks with an algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1861410">You implement the algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1863100">And maybe things work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864120">Maybe they don't converge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864890">But any case, you don't worry about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1868325">But we're not going to do that, because we want to do a</span> <span m="1870360">little bit more math, because we're interested</span> <span m="1872680">in stuff like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1874890">We're interested in the fact that the decision vector is a</span> <span m="1878770">linear sum of the samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1881265">So we're going to work a little harder on this stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884030">And in particular, now that we've got an expression for w,</span> <span m="1887730">this one right here, we're going to plug it back in</span> <span m="1891010">there, and we're going to plug it back in here and see what</span> <span m="1894870">happens to that thing we're trying to find</span> <span m="1897440">the extremum of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1906817">Is everybody relaxed, taking deep breath?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911220">Actually, this is the easiest part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1912530">This is just doing a little bit of the algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1915755">So the think we're trying to maximize or</span> <span m="1918830">minimize is equal to 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923465">And now, we've got to have this vector</span> <span m="1930570">here in there twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936781">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1937190">Because we're multiplying the two together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1941295">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1942970">We've got from that expression up there, one of those w's</span> <span m="1946860">will just be the sum of the alpha i times y sub i times</span> <span m="1953670">the vector x sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1956265">And then, we've got the other one, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1958320">So that's just going to be the sum of alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1961620">Now, I'm going to, actually, eventually, squish those two</span> <span m="1965280">sums together into a double summation, so I have to keep</span> <span m="1968050">the indexes straight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1969990">So I'm just going to write that as alpha sub j, y</span> <span m="1973786">sub j, x sub j.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1977726">So those are my two vectors and I'm going to take the dot</span> <span m="1979760">product of those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1980850">That's the first piece, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1984310">Boy, this is hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1987345">So minus, and now, the next term looks like alpha i, y sub</span> <span m="1993760">i, x sub i times w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997395">So you've got a whole bunch of these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1999640">We've got a sum of alpha i times y sub i times x sub i,</span> <span m="2006996">and then, that gets multiplied times w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010425">So we'll put this like this, the sum of alpha j, y sub j, x</span> <span m="2019160">sub j in there like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2021630">And then, that's the dot product like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2024345">That wasn't as bad as I thought.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2029731">Now, I've got to deal with the next term, the alpha i times y</span> <span m="2034150">sub i times b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2038475">So that's minus sub of alpha i times y sub i times b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2047746">And then, to finish it off, we have plus the sum of alpha sub</span> <span m="2053949">i minus 1 up there, minus 1 in front of the summation, such</span> <span m="2058320">as the sum of the alphas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060059">Are you with me so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2061605">Just a little algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2064096">It looks good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2064860">I think I haven't mucked it, yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2068838">Let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2070952">alpha i times y sub i times b. b is a constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2074364">So pull that out there, and then, I just got the sum of</span> <span m="2077409">alpha sub i times y sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2081078">Oh, that's good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2082250">That's 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2088304">Now, so for every one of these terms, we dot it with this</span> <span m="2091900">whole expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2094966">So that's just like taking this thing here and dotting</span> <span m="2100050">those two things together, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2102145">Oh, but that's just the same thing we've got here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107324">So now, what we can do is we can say that we can rewrite</span> <span m="2111140">this Lagrangian as--</span> <span m="2115560">we've got that sum of alpha i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2119566">That's the positive element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2122256">And then, we've got one of these and half of these.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2125680">So that's minus 1/2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2128865">And now, I'll just convert that whole works into a double</span> <span m="2130980">sum over both i and j of alpha i times alpha j times y sub i</span> <span m="2143230">times y sub j times x sub i dotted with x of j.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2152670">We sure went through a lot of trouble to get there, but now,</span> <span m="2155560">we've got it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2156210">And we know that what we're trying to do is we're trying</span> <span m="2159200">to find a maximum of that expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2167212">And that's the one we're going to had off to</span> <span m="2168910">the numerical analysts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2171010">So if we're going to had this off to the numerical analysts</span> <span m="2173090">anyway, why did I go to all this trouble?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2176136">Good question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2179200">Do you have any idea why I went to all this trouble?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2182626">Because I wanted to find out the dependence of this</span> <span m="2185440">expression.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2186950">Wanda is telling me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2188120">I'm translating as I go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189450">She's telling me in Romanian.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2191555">I want to find what this maximization depends on with</span> <span m="2195510">respect these vectors, the x, the sample vectors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201160">And what I've discovered is that the optimization depends</span> <span m="2206480">only on the dot product of pairs of samples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2213976">And that's something we want to keep in mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215300">That's why I put it in royal purple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219350">Now, up here, so let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2222920">What do we call that one up there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2224210">That's two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225715">I guess, we'll call this piece here three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2230505">This piece here is four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2232600">And now, there's one more piece.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2235060">Because I want to take that w, and not only stick it back</span> <span m="2240080">into that Lagrangian, I want to stick it back into the</span> <span m="2242700">decision rule.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244446">So now, my decision rule with this expression for w is going</span> <span m="2249030">to be w plugged into that thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2251410">So the decision rule is going to look like the sum of alpha</span> <span m="2257000">i times y sub i times x sub i dotted with the unknown</span> <span m="2265960">vector, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2267840">And we're going to, I guess, add b.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271536">And we're going to say, if that's greater than or equal</span> <span m="2273770">to 0, then plus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2280560">So you see why the math is beginning to sing to us now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284750">Because now, we discover that the decision rule, also,</span> <span m="2288840">depends only on the dot product of those sample</span> <span m="2292700">vectors and the unknown.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2295340">So the total of dependence of all of the</span> <span m="2298640">math on the dot products.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2301106">All right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2304034">And now, I hear a whisper.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2307160">Someone is saying, I don't believe that</span> <span m="2310410">mathematicians can do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2311720">I don't think those numerical analysts can find the</span> <span m="2313850">optimization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2317360">I want to be sure of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2318925">Give me ocular proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2320850">So I'd like to run a demonstration of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2336596">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2337090">There's our sample problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2338060">The one I started the hour out with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2339800">Now, if the optimization algorithm doesn't get stuck in</span> <span m="2345430">a local maximum or something, it should find a nice,</span> <span m="2347720">straight line separating those two guys to finding the widest</span> <span m="2350900">street between the minuses and the pluses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354445">So in just a couple of steps, you can see down</span> <span m="2356880">there in step 11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358150">It's decided that it's done as much as it can on the</span> <span m="2360630">optimization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2362406">And it's got three alphas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2365480">And you can see that the two negative samples both figure</span> <span m="2370970">into the solution, the weights on the Lagrangian multipliers</span> <span m="2374575">are given by those little yellow bars.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2376820">So the two negatives participate in the solution as</span> <span m="2380030">one of the positives, but the other positive doesn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2382040">So it has a 0 weight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2385500">So everything worked out well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2387700">Now, I said, as long as it doesn't get stuck on a local</span> <span m="2390440">maximum, guess what, those mathematical friends of ours</span> <span m="2395095">can tell us and prove to us that this</span> <span m="2398120">thing is a convex space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400420">That means it can never get stuck in a local maximum.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404042">So in contrast with things like neural nets, where you</span> <span m="2407780">have a plague of local maxima, this guy never gets stuck in a</span> <span m="2411160">local maxima.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2412355">Let's try some other examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2415536">Here's two vertical points--</span> <span m="2417250">no surprises there, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2420920">Well, you say, well, maybe it can't deal</span> <span m="2422470">with diagonal points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424165">Sure it can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2426830">How about this thing here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432091">Yeah, it only needed two of the points since any two, a</span> <span m="2438510">plus or minus, will define the street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2441820">Let's try this guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2444580">Oh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2446526">What do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2447110">What happened here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2450046">Well, we're screwed, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2451345">Because it's linearly inseparable--</span> <span m="2456629">bad news.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2460175">So in situations where it's linearly inseparable, the</span> <span m="2464250">mechanism struggles, and eventually, it will just slow</span> <span m="2467060">down and you truncate it, because it's</span> <span m="2468570">not making any progress.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2469510">And you see the red dots there are ones that it got wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474765">So you say, well, too bad for our side-- doesn't look like</span> <span m="2477480">it's all that good anyway.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2479502">But then, a powerful idea comes to the rescue, when</span> <span m="2486020">stuck switch to another perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2488896">So if we don't like the space that we're in, because it</span> <span m="2491850">gives examples that are not linearly separable, then we</span> <span m="2497680">can say, oh, shoot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2499705">Here's our space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2502052">Here are two points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2509486">Here are two other points.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2512944">We can't separate them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514630">But if we could somehow get them into another space, maybe</span> <span m="2517740">we can separate them, because they look like this in the</span> <span m="2526600">other space, and they're easy to separate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528925">So what we need, then, is a transformation that will take</span> <span m="2532820">us from the space we're in into a space where things are</span> <span m="2536070">more convenient, so we're going to call that</span> <span m="2537590">transformation phi with a vector, x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2542745">That's the transformation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543855">And now, here's the reason for all the magic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2548950">I said, that the maximization only depends on dot products.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2554880">So all I need to do the maximization is the</span> <span m="2558810">transformation of one vector dotted with the transformation</span> <span m="2563975">of another vector, like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2567235">That's what I need to maximize, or to find the</span> <span m="2571260">maximum on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2572510">Then, in order to recognize--</span> <span m="2575216">where did it go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2577706">Underneath the chalkboard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2585290">Oh, yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2586002">Here it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2586900">To recognize, all I need is dot products, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2589620">So for that one I need phi of x dotted with phi of u.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2597025">And just to make this a little bit more consistent, the</span> <span m="2599300">notation, I'll call that x j and this x sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2602750">And that's x sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2603550">Those are the quantities I need in order to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2607595">So that means that if I have a function, let's call it k of x</span> <span m="2614540">sub i and x sub j, that's equal to phi of x sub i dotted</span> <span m="2625370">with phi of x sub j.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2629191">Then, I'm done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2630215">This is what I need.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2632306">I don't actually need this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2636955">All I need is that function, k, which happens to be called</span> <span m="2640990">a kernel function, which provides me with the dot</span> <span m="2644650">product of those two vectors in another space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647745">I don't have to know the transformation</span> <span m="2649310">into the other space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651200">And that's the reason that this stuff is a miracle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2655935">So what are some of the kernels that are popular?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2659595">One is the linear kernel that says that u dotted with v plus</span> <span m="2667200">1 to the n-th is such a kernel, because it's got u in</span> <span m="2672515">it and v in it, the two vectors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675190">And this is what the dot product is in the other space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2678060">So that's one choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2679550">Another choice is a kernel that looks like</span> <span m="2682450">this, e to the minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686295">Let's take the dot product of the difference</span> <span m="2690440">of those two guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693880">Let's take the magnitude of that and</span> <span m="2696360">divide it by some sigma.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2697660">That's a second kind of kernel that we can use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2701160">So let's go back and see if we can solve this problem by</span> <span m="2704350">transforming it into another space where we have another</span> <span m="2706350">perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2710082">So that's it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2715618">That's another kernel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2717760">And so sure, we can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2718870">And that's the answer when transformed back into the</span> <span m="2721280">original space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722905">We can also try doing that with a so-called</span> <span m="2724690">radial basis kernel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2725780">That's the one with the exponential in it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2728112">We can learn on that one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729310">Boom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2730480">No problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2733346">So we've got a general method that's convex and guaranteed</span> <span m="2736860">to produce a global solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2739245">We've got a mechanism that easily allows us to transform</span> <span m="2742950">this into another space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2745470">So it works like a charm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2747695">Of course, it doesn't remove all possible problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2750736">Look at that exponential thing here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2753650">If we choose a sigma that is small enough, then those</span> <span m="2759890">sigmas are essentially shrunk right around the sample</span> <span m="2762760">points, and we could get overfitting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2766092">So it doesn't immunize us against overfitting, but it</span> <span m="2769385">does immunize us against local maxima and does provide us</span> <span m="2772500">with a general mechanism for doing a transformation into</span> <span m="2776820">another space with a better perspective.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2778935">Now, the history lesson, all this stuff feels fairly new.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782435">It feels like it's younger than you are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2785746">Here's the history of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2787822">Vapnik immigrated from the Soviet Union to the United</span> <span m="2791060">States in about 1991.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793760">Nobody ever heard of this stuff before he immigrated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2796795">He actually had done this work on the basic support vector</span> <span m="2800200">idea in his Ph.D. thesis at Moscow University</span> <span m="2804355">in the early '60s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2806590">But it wasn't possible for him to do anything with it,</span> <span m="2809470">because they didn't have any computers they could try</span> <span m="2811220">anything out with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2813010">So he spent the next 25 years at some oncology institute in</span> <span m="2817460">the Soviet Union doing applications.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2820660">Somebody from Bell Labs discovers him, invites him</span> <span m="2823440">over to the United States where, subsequently, he</span> <span m="2825445">decides to immigrate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2827466">In 1992, or thereabouts, Vapnik submits three papers to</span> <span m="2833580">NIPS, the Neural Information Processing Systems journal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2837115">All of them were rejected.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2839065">He's still sore about it, but it's motivating.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843570">So around 1992, 1993, Bell Labs was interested in</span> <span m="2847060">hand-written character recognition</span> <span m="2848420">and in neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2850456">Vapnik thinks that neural nets--</span> <span m="2853270">what would be a good word to use?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2856295">I can think of the vernacular, but he thinks that</span> <span m="2858410">they're not very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2860150">So he bets a colleague a good dinner that support vector</span> <span m="2864320">machines will eventually do better at handwriting</span> <span m="2866385">recognition then neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2870356">And it's a dinner bet, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2871690">It's not that big of deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872600">But as Napoleon said, it's amazing what a soldier will do</span> <span m="2875280">for a bit of ribbon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2877641">So that makes colleague, who's working on this problem with</span> <span m="2881380">handwritten recognition, decides to try a support</span> <span m="2886730">vector machine with a kernel, in which n equals 2, just</span> <span m="2892700">slightly nonlinear, works like a charm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2897530">Was this the first time anybody tried a kernel?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2899890">Vapnik actually had the idea in his thesis but never though</span> <span m="2903070">it was very important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2905560">As soon as it was shown to work in the early '90s on the</span> <span m="2909670">problem handwriting recognition, Vapnik</span> <span m="2912090">resuscitated the idea of the kernel, began to develop it,</span> <span m="2915190">and became an essential part of the whole approach of using</span> <span m="2918270">support vector machines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2919920">So the main point about this is that it was 30 years in</span> <span m="2923980">between the concept and anybody ever hearing about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2927380">It was 30 years between Vapnik's understanding of</span> <span m="2932360">kernels and his appreciation of their importance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2935840">And that's the way things often go, great ideas followed</span> <span m="2939870">by long periods of nothing happening, followed by an</span> <span m="2943320">epiphanous moment when the original idea seemed to have</span> <span m="2946640">great power with just a little bit of a twist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2949320">And then, the world never looks back.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2950960">And Vapnik, who nobody ever heard of until the early '90s,</span> <span m="2954780">becomes famous for something that everybody knows about</span> <span m="2958380">today who does machine learning.</span> </p>

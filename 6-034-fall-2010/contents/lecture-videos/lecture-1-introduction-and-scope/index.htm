<p><span m="18200">PATRICK WINSTON: Welcome to 6034.</span> </p>
<p><span m="26190">I don't know if I can deal with this microphone.</span> </p>
<p><span m="28230">We'll see what happens.</span> </p>
<p><span m="29405">It's going to be a good year.</span> </p>
<p><span m="30380">We've got [INAUDIBLE] a bunch of interesting people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="33530">It's always interesting to see what people named their</span> <span m="35790">children two decades ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="39820">And I find they were overwhelmed with Emilys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="42510">And there are not too many Peters, Pauls, and Marys, but</span> <span m="45420">enough to call forth a suitable song at some point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="50540">We have lots of Jesses of both genders.</span> </p>
<p><span m="55630">We have a [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="57220">of both genders.</span> </p>
<p><span m="59890">And we have a Duncan, where's Duncan?</span> </p>
<p><span m="62810">There you are, Duncan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="64080">You've changed your hairstyle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="66900">I want to assure use that the Thane of Cawdor is not taking</span> <span m="70130">the course this semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="72390">What I'm going to do is tell you about artificial</span> <span m="74890">intelligence today, and what this subject is about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="78680">There's been about a 10% percent turnover in the roster</span> <span m="84100">in the last 24 hours.</span> </p>
<p><span m="85320">I expect another 10% turnover in the next 24 hours, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="89680">So I know many of you are sightseers, wanting to know if</span> <span m="92600">this is something you want to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="93720">So I'm going to tell you about what we're going to do this</span> <span m="96140">semester, and what you'll know when you get out of here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="100229">I'm going to walk you through this outline.</span> </p>
<p><span m="103620">I'm going to start by talking about what artificial</span> <span m="105539">intelligence is, and why we do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="108630">And then I'll give you a little bit of the history of</span> <span m="110160">artificial intelligence, and conclude with some of the</span> <span m="114000">covenants by which we run the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="116570">One of which is no laptops, please.</span> </p>
<p><span m="120900">I'll explain why we have these covenants at the end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="125620">So what is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="127360">Well, it must have something to do with thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="132220">So let's start up here, a definition of artificial</span> <span m="135280">intelligence, by saying that it's about thinking,</span> <span m="141820">whatever that is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="143850">My definition of artificial intelligence has</span> <span m="146100">to be rather broad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="148560">So we're going to say it's not only about thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="151710">It's also about perception, and it's about action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="162610">And if this were a philosophy class, then I'd stop right</span> <span m="166060">there and just say, in this subject we're going to talk</span> <span m="169120">about problems involving thinking,</span> <span m="172370">perception, and action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="174860">But this is not a philosophy class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="177890">This a Course six class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="179050">It's an engineering school class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="180350">It's an MIT class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="182000">So we need more than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="183940">And therefore we're going to talk about models that are</span> <span m="192380">targeted at thinking, perception, and action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="200329">And this should not be strange to you, because model making</span> <span m="203800">is what MIT is about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="206900">You run into someone at a bar, or relative asks you what you</span> <span m="209540">do at MIT, the right knee jerk reaction is to say, we learned</span> <span m="213200">how to build models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="215130">That's what we do at MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="216990">We build the models using differential equations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="220570">We build models using probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="223450">We build models using physical and computational simulations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227829">Whatever we do, we build models.</span> </p>
<p><span m="230300">Even in humanities class, MIT approach is to make models</span> <span m="235710">that we can use to explain the past, predict the future,</span> <span m="240290">understand the subject, and control the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="243050">That's what MIT is about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="244290">And that's what this subject is about, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="246400">And now, our models are models of thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="250650">So you might say, if I take this</span> <span m="252060">classic will I get smarter?</span> </p>
<p><span m="253840">And the answer is yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="254760">You will get smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="255500">Because you'll have better models of your own thinking,</span> <span m="257980">not just the subject matter of the subject, but better models</span> <span m="261120">of your own thinking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="263840">So models targeted at thinking,</span> <span m="265370">perception, and action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="267670">We know that's not quite enough, because in order to</span> <span m="269460">have a model, you have to have representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="273790">So let's say that artificial intelligence is about</span> <span m="277040">representations that support the making of models to</span> <span m="292470">facilitate an understanding of thinking,</span> <span m="295040">perception, and action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="297500">Now you might say to me, well what's a representation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="299409">And what good can it do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="300170">So I'd like to take a brief moment to tell you about</span> <span m="302780">gyroscopes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="303540">Many of you have friends in mechanical engineering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="306380">One of the best ways embarrass them is to say here's a</span> <span m="310980">bicycle wheel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="312210">And if I spin it, and blow hard on it right here, on the</span> <span m="316720">edge of the wheel, is going to turn over</span> <span m="319110">this way or this way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="323160">I guarantee that what they will do is they'll put their</span> <span m="326250">hand in an arthritic posture called the right hand screw</span> <span m="329400">rule, aptly named because people who use it tend to get</span> <span m="335870">the right answer about 50% of the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="341460">But we're never going to make that mistake again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="344560">Because we're electrical engineers,</span> <span m="345780">not mechanical engineers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="346820">And we know about representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="349300">What we're going to do is we're going to think about it</span> <span m="351290">a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="352486">And we're going to use some duct tape to help us think</span> <span m="354780">about just one piece of the wheel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357730">So I want you to just think about that piece of the wheel</span> <span m="361270">as the wheel comes flying over the top, and I</span> <span m="363050">blow on it like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="364810">What's going to happen to that one piece?</span> </p>
<p><span m="368090">It's going to go off that way, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="370520">And the next piece is going to go off that way too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="373400">So when it comes over, it has to go that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="377610">Let me do some ground f here just to be sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="382200">It's very powerful feeling.</span> </p>
<p><span m="386760">Try it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="388730">We need a demonstration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="389540">I don't anybody think that I'm cheating, here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="393010">So let's just twist it one way or the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="399840">So that's powerful pull, isn't it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="402100">Alex is now never going to get the gyroscope wrong, because</span> <span m="406820">he's got the right representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="409870">So much of what you're going to accumulate in this subject</span> <span m="412130">is a suite of representations that will help you to build</span> <span m="414560">programs that are intelligent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="416990">But I want to give you a second example, one a little</span> <span m="420330">bit more computational.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421300">But one of which was very familiar to you by the time</span> <span m="423990">you went to first grade, in most cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="426690">It's the problem of the farmer, the fox, the goose,</span> <span m="429610">and the grain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="431020">There's a river, a leaky rowboat that can only carry</span> <span m="434070">the farmer, and one of his four possessions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="437340">So what's the right</span> <span m="438080">representation for this problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="441220">It might be a picture of the farmer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="444370">It might be a poem about the situation, perhaps a haiku.</span> </p>
<p><span m="449570">We know that those are not the right representation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="453240">Somehow, we get the sense that the right representation most</span> <span m="458340">involve something about the location of the participants</span> <span m="462440">in this scenario.</span> </p>
<p><span m="464270">So we might draw a picture that looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="468480">There's the scenario, and here in glorious green,</span> <span m="474150">representing our algae infested rivers is the river.</span> </p>
<p><span m="478450">And here's the farmer, the fox, the goose, and the grain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485306">An initial situation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="487900">Now there are other situations like this one, for example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="493360">We have the river, and the farmer, and the</span> <span m="499200">goose is on that side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="501590">And the fox and the grain is on that side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="506160">And we know that the farmer can execute a movement from</span> <span m="511520">one situation to another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="514929">So now we're getting somewhere where with the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="516980">This is at MIT approach to the farmer, fox,</span> <span m="519120">goose, and grain problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="520010">It might have stumped you when you were a little kid.</span> </p>
<p><span m="525370">How many such situations are there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="530180">What do you think, Tanya?</span> </p>
<p><span m="532632">It looks to me like all four of individuals can be on one</span> <span m="536280">side or the other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="538740">So for every position the farmer can be, each of the</span> <span m="541480">other things can be on either side of the river.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546060">So it would be two to the fourth she says aggressively</span> <span m="549500">and without hesitation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="552060">Yes, two to the fourth, 16 possibilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="554020">So we could actually draw out the entire graph.</span> </p>
<p><span m="557590">It's small enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="559770">There's another position over here with the farmer, fox,</span> <span m="564620">goose, and grain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="565832">And in fact that's the one we want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="568560">And if we draw out the entire graph, it looks like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="575910">This is a graph of the situations and the allowed</span> <span m="580250">connections between them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="582960">Why are there not 16?</span> </p>
<p><span m="587280">Because the other--</span> <span m="588420">how many have I got?</span> </p>
<p><span m="589170">Four?</span> </p>
<p><span m="589625">10?</span> </p>
<p><span m="591720">The others are situations in which somebody gets eaten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="595600">So we don't want to go to any of those places.</span> </p>
<p><span m="598490">So having got the representation, something</span> <span m="600850">magical has happened.</span> </p>
<p><span m="602750">We've got our constraints exposed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="618420">And that's why we build representations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="619860">That's whey you algebra in high school, because algebraic</span> <span m="623080">notation exposes the constraints that make it</span> <span m="625410">possible to actually figure out how many customers you get</span> <span m="629630">for the number of advertisements you place in</span> <span m="631510">the newspaper.</span> </p>
<p><span m="634420">So artificial intelligence is about constraints exposed by</span> <span m="636870">representations that support models targeted to thinking--</span> <span m="639760">actually there's one more thing, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="641450">Not quite done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="642800">Because after all, in the end, we have to build programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="648500">So it's about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed</span> <span m="664820">by representations that model targeted thinking, perception,</span> <span m="669510">and action.</span> </p>
<p><span m="671000">So these algorithms, or we might call them just as well</span> <span m="675520">procedures, or we might call them just as well methods,</span> <span m="678620">whatever you like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="680030">These are the stuff of what artificial intelligence is</span> <span m="681980">about-- methods, algorithms, representations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="684860">I'd like to give you one more example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="687470">It's something we call, in artificial intelligence,</span> <span m="689570">generated test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="691770">And it's such a simple idea, you'll never hear it again in</span> <span m="693640">this subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="694840">But it's an idea you need to add to your repertoire of</span> <span m="697130">problem solving methods, techniques, procedures, and</span> <span m="700780">algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="702900">So here's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="708380">Maybe I can explain to best by starting off with an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712370">Here's a tree leaf I picked off a tree on</span> <span m="715590">the way over to class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="716760">I hope it's not the last of the species.</span> </p>
<p><span m="719950">What is it, what kind of tree?</span> </p>
<p><span m="725680">I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="726720">I never did learn my trees, or my colors, or my</span> <span m="729870">multiplication tables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="731910">So I have to go back to this book, the Audubon Society</span> <span m="737060">Field Guide to North American Trees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="738870">And how would I solve the problem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="741160">It's pretty simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="741790">I just turn the pages one at a time, until I find something</span> <span m="746490">that looks like this leaf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="748700">And then I discover it's a sycamore, or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="753190">MIT's full of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="755930">So when I do that, I do something very intuitive, very</span> <span m="759660">natural, something you do all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="761070">But we're going to give it a name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762550">We're going to call it generate and test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="775510">And generate and test method consists of generating some</span> <span m="779790">possible solutions, feeding them into a box that tests</span> <span m="784260">them, and then out the other side comes mostly failures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790760">But every once in a while we get something that succeeds</span> <span m="794890">and pleases us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797240">That's what I did with the leaf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="798960">But now you have a name for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801340">Once you have a name for something, you</span> <span m="805490">get power over it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="806860">You can start to talk about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="808970">So I can say, if you're doing a generate and test approach</span> <span m="812180">to a problem, you better build a generator with certain</span> <span m="817280">properties that make generators good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="820210">For example, they should not be redundant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="822940">They shouldn't give you the same solution twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="826210">They should be informable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829680">They should be able to absorb information such as, this is a</span> <span m="832620">deciduous tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="833650">Don't bother looking at the conifers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="836260">So once you have a name for something, you can start</span> <span m="838130">talking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="839370">And that vocabulary gives you power.</span> </p>
<p><span m="842580">So we call this the Rumpelstiltskin Principle</span> <span m="846610">perhaps The first of our powerful ideas for the day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="850530">This subject is full of powerful ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852180">There will be some in every class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="854300">Rumpelstiltskin Principle says that once you can name</span> <span m="856480">something, you get power over it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="858250">You know what that little thing is on</span> <span m="859220">the end of your shoelace?</span> </p>
<p><span m="863650">It's interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="864280">She's gesturing like mad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="866480">That's something we'll talk about later, too--</span> <span m="868920">motor stuff, and how it helps us think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="872070">What is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="873310">No one knows?</span> </p>
<p><span m="875500">It's an ag something, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="876780">It's an aglet, very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="878910">So once you have the name, you can start to talk about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="881460">You can say the purpose of an aglet is pretty much like the</span> <span m="884320">whipping on the end of a rope.</span> </p>
<p><span m="885590">It keeps the thing from unwinding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="888140">Now you have a place to hang that knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="891140">So we're talking about this frequently from now into the</span> <span m="894730">rest of the semester, the power of being</span> <span m="896680">able to name things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="898010">Symbolic labels give us power over concepts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="901850">While we're here I should also say that this is a very simple</span> <span m="904290">idea, generate and test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="906570">And you might be tempted to say to someone, we learned</span> <span m="909770">about generate and test today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="911470">But it's a trivial idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="914290">The word trivial is a word I would like you to purge from</span> <span m="917030">your vocabulary, because it's a very dangerous label.</span> </p>
<p><span m="922340">The reason it's dangerous is because there's a difference</span> <span m="925970">between trivial and simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927360">What is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="930310">What's the difference between labeling something as trivial</span> <span m="933320">and calling it simple?</span> </p>
<p><span m="934570">Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="939440">Exactly so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="940450">He says that simple can be powerful, and trivial makes it</span> <span m="944950">sound like it's not only simple, but of little worth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="948830">So many MIT people miss opportunities, because they</span> <span m="953060">have a tendency to think that ideas aren't important unless</span> <span m="955270">they're complicated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="957660">But the most simple ideas in artificial intelligence are</span> <span m="959965">often the most powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="962120">We could teach an artificial intelligence course to you</span> <span m="964130">that would be so full of mathematics it would make a</span> <span m="966180">Course 18 professor gag.</span> </p>
<p><span m="969150">But those ideas would be merely gratuitously</span> <span m="971900">complicated, and gratuitously mathematical, and gratuitously</span> <span m="975590">not simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="976940">Simple ideas are often the most powerful.</span> </p>
<p><span m="982460">So where are we so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="984570">We talked about the definition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="987165">We talked about an example of a method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="989660">Showed you a representation, and perhaps also talked about</span> <span m="992560">the first idea, too.</span> </p>
<p><span m="994220">You've got the representation right, you're</span> <span m="996690">often almost done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998440">Because with this representation, they can</span> <span m="1001030">immediately see that there are just two solutions to this</span> <span m="1004580">problem, something that wouldn't have occurred to us</span> <span m="1008930">when we were little kids, and didn't think to draw the</span> <span m="1010630">[? state ?] diagram.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1016640">There's still one more thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1021410">In the past, and in other places, artificial</span> <span m="1024740">intelligence is often taught as purely about reasoning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1029108">But we solve problems with our eyes, as well as</span> <span m="1032515">our symbolic apparatus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1035420">And you solved that problem with your eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1038858">So I like to reinforce that by giving you a little puzzle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042839">Let's see, who's here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050370">I don't see [? Kambe, ?] but I'll bet he's from Africa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1052420">Is anyone from Africa?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1054610">No one's from Africa?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1057180">No?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1058960">Well so much the better--</span> <span m="1066090">because they would know the answer to the puzzle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1067760">Here's the puzzle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1069230">How many countries in Africa does the Equator cross?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1076690">Would anybody be willing to stake their</span> <span m="1078290">life on their answer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1082520">Probably not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1086910">Well, now let me repeat the question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1096550">How many countries in Africa does the Equator cross?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1101995">Yeah, six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1103040">What happened is a miracle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105970">The miracle is that I have communicated with you through</span> <span m="1109770">language, and your language system commanded your visual</span> <span m="1114660">system to execute a program that involves scanning across</span> <span m="1118590">that line, counting as you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1121390">And then your vision system came back to your language</span> <span m="1123770">system and said, six.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1125950">And that is a miracle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127575">And without understanding that miracle, we'll never have a</span> <span m="1130600">full understanding of the nature of intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1133330">But that kind of problem solving is the kind of problem</span> <span m="1135720">solving I wish we could teach you a lot about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1137950">But we can't teach you about stuff we don't understand.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140420">We [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1141500">for that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145540">That's a little bit about the definition and some examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1148930">What's it for?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150460">We can deal with that very quickly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152530">If we're engineers, it's for building smarter programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1156440">It's about building a tool kit of representations and methods</span> <span m="1160690">that make it possible to build smarter programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1162660">And you will find, these days, that you can't build a big</span> <span m="1165660">system without having embedded in it somewhere the ideas that</span> <span m="1168520">we talk about in the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1171230">If you're a scientist, there's a somewhat different</span> <span m="1173420">motivation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1173970">But it amounts to studying the same sorts of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1176420">If you're a scientist, you're interested in what it is that</span> <span m="1180800">enables us to build a computational account of</span> <span m="1183800">intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1185110">That's the part that I do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1186910">But most this subject is going to be about the other part,</span> <span m="1189620">the part that makes it possible for you to build</span> <span m="1192440">smarter programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1193510">And some of it will be about what it is that makes us</span> <span m="1196990">different from the chimpanzees with whom we share an enormous</span> <span m="1202900">fraction of our DNA.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1205130">It used to be thought that we share 95% of our DNA with</span> <span m="1208010">chimpanzees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1209840">Then it went up to 98.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1213660">Thank God it stopped about there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1215470">Then it actually went back a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1216770">I think we're back down to 94.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1223350">How about if we talk a little bit now about the history of</span> <span m="1225190">AI, so we can see how we got to where we are today?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1228940">This will also be a history of AI that tells you a little bit</span> <span m="1231040">about what you'll learn in this course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1236610">It all started with Lady Lovelace, the world's first</span> <span m="1242730">programmer, Who wrote programs about 100 years before there</span> <span m="1247750">were computers to run them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1250500">But it's interesting that even in 1842, people were hassling</span> <span m="1254140">her about whether computers could get really smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1257200">And she said, "The analytical engine has no pretensions to</span> <span m="1263370">originate anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1265500">It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."</span> <span m="1270080">Screwball idea that persists to this day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1273600">Nevertheless, that was the origin of it all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1275730">That was the beginning of the discussions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1277330">And then nothing much happened until about 1950, when Alan</span> <span m="1282050">Turing wrote his famous paper, which</span> <span m="1284110">introduced the Turing test.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1287090">Of course, Alan Turing had previously won the Second</span> <span m="1289340">World War by breaking the German code, the Ultra Code,</span> <span m="1294090">for which the British government rewarded him by</span> <span m="1296240">driving him to suicide, because he happened to be</span> <span m="1298180">homosexual.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1301040">But Turing wrote his paper in 1950, and that was the first</span> <span m="1304260">milestone after Lady Lovelace's comment in 1842.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1308720">And then the modern era really began with a paper written by</span> <span m="1313140">Marvin Minsky in 1960, titled "Steps Toward Artificial</span> <span m="1316120">Intelligence." And it wasn't a long after that Jim</span> <span m="1319530">[? Slagle, ?]</span> <span m="1321490">a nearly blind graduate student, wrote a program that</span> <span m="1323830">did symbolic integration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1327270">Not adding up area under a curve, but doing symbolic</span> <span m="1329850">integration just like you learn to do in high school</span> <span m="1331870">when you're a freshman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1334470">Now on Monday, we're going to talk about this program.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1336560">And you're going to understand exactly how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1338730">And you can write one yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1341570">And we're going to reach way back in time to look at that</span> <span m="1343730">program because, in one day discussing it, talking about</span> <span m="1347400">it, will be in itself a miniature artificial</span> <span m="1349500">intelligence course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1350360">Because it's so rich with important ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355250">So that's the dawn age, early dawn age.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1359310">This was the age of speculation, and this was the</span> <span m="1369810">dawn age in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1373820">So in that early dawn age , the integration program took</span> <span m="1377600">the world by storm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1378390">Because not everybody knows how to do integration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380280">And someone, everyone, thought that if we can do integration</span> <span m="1383580">today, the rest of intelligence will be figured</span> <span m="1385420">out tomorrow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1386882">Too bad for our side it didn't work out that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1390580">Here's another dawn age program, the Eliza</span> <span m="1394200">[? thing ?].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395220">But I imagine you'd prefer a demonstration to</span> <span m="1397590">just reading it, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399455">Do you prefer a demonstration?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402870">Let's see if we can demonstrate it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448250">This is left over from a hamentashen debate of a couple</span> <span m="1451400">of years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1453411">How do you spell hamentashen, anybody know?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1459450">I sure hope that's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1460600">It doesn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1461390">Something interesting will come.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1465920">OK, your choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1468580">Teal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1471310">Burton House?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475890">Teal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1487810">So that's dawn age AI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1489710">And no one ever took that stuff seriously, except that</span> <span m="1493700">it was a fun [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1494900">project level thing to work out some matching</span> <span m="1497980">programs, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1499810">The integration program was serious.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1501310">This one wasn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1503240">This was serious, programs that do geometric analogy,</span> <span m="1506940">problems of the kind you find on intelligence tests.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509020">Do you have the answer to this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1509990">A is to B as C is to what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514260">That would be 2, I guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518270">What's the second best answer?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1522070">And the theories of the program that solve these</span> <span m="1524750">problems are pretty much identical to what you just</span> <span m="1528990">figured out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1530460">In the first case you deleted the inside figure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535970">And the second case is, the reason you got four is because</span> <span m="1538280">you deleted the outside part and grew the inside part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1544340">There's another one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546670">I think this was the hardest one it got, or the easiest one</span> <span m="1549510">it didn't get.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1550110">I've forgotten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1551300">A is to B as C is to 3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1557490">In the late dawn age, we began to turn our attention from</span> <span m="1560180">purely symbolic reasoning to thinking a little bit about</span> <span m="1563010">perceptual apparatus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1564600">And programs were written that could figure out the nature of</span> <span m="1567410">shapes and forms, such as that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1571800">And it's interesting that those programs had the same</span> <span m="1574200">kind of difficulty with this that you do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1579920">Because now, having deleted all the edges, everything</span> <span m="1582410">becomes ambiguous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1583840">And it may be a series of platforms, or it may be a</span> <span m="1586790">series of--</span> <span m="1587615">can you see the saw blade sticking up if you go through</span> <span m="1590520">the reversal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1593790">Programs were written that could learn from a small</span> <span m="1595750">number of examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1597600">Many people think of computer learning as involving leading</span> <span m="1601490">some neural net to submission with thousands of trials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1606030">Programs were written in the early dawn age that learned</span> <span m="1608280">that an arch is something that has to have the flat part on</span> <span m="1611980">top, and the two sides can't touch, and the top may or may</span> <span m="1615180">not be a wedge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1619630">In the late dawn age, though, the most important thing,</span> <span m="1621880">perhaps, was what you look at with me on Wednesday next.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1626302">It's a rule-based expert systems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1629120">And a program was written at Stanford that did diagnosis of</span> <span m="1634740">bacterial infections of the blood.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636520">It turned out to do it better than most doctors, most</span> <span m="1641040">general practitioners.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1642860">It was never used, curiously enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1646990">Because nobody cares what your problem actually is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1651360">They just give you a broad spectrum antibiotic that'll</span> <span m="1653420">kill everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1656700">But this late dawn age system, the so-called [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1659700">system, was the system that launched a thousand companies,</span> <span m="1666440">because people started building expert systems built</span> <span m="1668960">on that technology.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1670040">Here's that you don't know you used, or that was</span> <span m="1672130">used on your behalf.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1673430">If you go through, for example, the Atlanta airport,</span> <span m="1676570">your airplane is parked by a rule-based expert system that</span> <span m="1679380">knows how to park aircraft effectively.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1683430">It saves Delta Airlines about to $0.5 million a day of jet</span> <span m="1689841">fuel by being all smarter about how to park them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1693780">So that's an example of an expert system that does a</span> <span m="1695760">little bit of good for a lot of people.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1699680">There's Deep Blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700600">That takes us to the next stage beyond the age of expert</span> <span m="1707930">systems, and the business age.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1710410">It takes us into this age here, which I call the</span> <span m="1713250">bulldozer age, because this is the time when people began to</span> <span m="1723260">see that we had at our disposal</span> <span m="1726390">unlimited amounts of computing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1728700">And frequently you can substitute computing for</span> <span m="1730880">intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1732930">So no one would say that Deep Blue does anything like what a</span> <span m="1736420">human chess master does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1739230">But nevertheless, Deep Blue, by processing data like a</span> <span m="1744180">bulldozer processes gravel, was able to</span> <span m="1746700">beat the world champion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1751910">So what's the right way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753100">That's the age we're in right now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755390">I will of course be inducing programs for those ages as we</span> <span m="1758420">go through the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1759940">There is a question of what age we're in right now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1762950">And it's always dangerous to name an age when</span> <span m="1764840">you're in it, I guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1766640">I like to call at the age of the right way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1770660">And this is an age when we begin to realize that that</span> <span m="1773270">definition up there is actually a little incomplete,</span> <span m="1776750">because much of our intelligence has to do not</span> <span m="1781630">with thinking, perception, and action acting separately, but</span> <span m="1787920">with loops that tie all those together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1795510">We had one example with Africa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1797490">Here's another example drawn from a program that has been</span> <span m="1802270">under development, and continues to be, in my</span> <span m="1804960">laboratory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1811490">We're going to ask the system to imagine something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818670">SYSTEM: OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1819610">I will imagine that a ball falls into a bowl.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1833098">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1833584">I will imagine that a man runs into a woman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1838930">PATRICK WINSTON: You see, it does the best that it can if</span> <span m="1840240">it doesn't have a good memory of what these situations</span> <span m="1843440">actually involve.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1845005">But having imagined the scene it can then--</span> <span m="1848130">SYSTEM: Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1848620">I have learned from experience that contact between a man and</span> <span m="1852110">a woman appeared because a man runs into a woman.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1856240">PATRICK WINSTON: Having imagined the scene, it can</span> <span m="1858110">then read the answers using its visual apparatus on the</span> <span m="1861740">scene that it imagined.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1863580">So just like what you did with Africa, only now it's working</span> <span m="1866530">with its own visual memory, using visual programs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872026">SYSTEM: OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872507">I will imagine that a man gives a ball to a man.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1877330">PATRICK WINSTON: I know this looks like slugs, but they're</span> <span m="1881050">actually distinguished professors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1886500">It always does the best it can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1890465">SYSTEM: OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1891451">I will imagine that a man flies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1899560">PATRICK WINSTON: It's the best that it can do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1907870">So that concludes our discussion of the history.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911920">And I've provided you with a little bit of a glimpse of</span> <span m="1914240">what we're going to look at as the semester unfolds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1917880">Yes, Chris?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1920410">CHRIS: Is it actually a demonstration of something?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923880">Does it have a large database of videos?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1926200">PATRICK WINSTON: No, it has a small database videos.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1928676">CHRIS: But it's intelligently picking among them based on--</span> <span m="1933480">PATRICK WINSTON: Based on their content.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1936140">So if you say imagine that a student gave a ball to another</span> <span m="1940570">student, it imagines that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943170">You say, now does the other student have the ball?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1946430">Does the other student take the ball?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1947590">It can answer those questions because it can review the same</span> <span m="1950030">video and see the take as well as the give in the same video.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1955760">So now we have to think about why we ought to be optimistic</span> <span m="1962840">about the future.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1964460">Because we've had a long history here, and we haven't</span> <span m="1967210">solved the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1968830">But one reason why we can feel optimistic about future is</span> <span m="1971350">because all of our friends have been on the march.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1974580">And our friends include the cognitive psychologists, the</span> <span m="1977950">[? developmental ?]</span> <span m="1978930">psychologists, the linguists, sometimes the philosophers,</span> <span m="1982200">and especially the paleoanthropologists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1986040">Because it is becoming increasingly clear why we're</span> <span m="1989430">actually different from the chimpanzees, and how we got to</span> <span m="1992780">be that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1994690">The high school idea is that we evolved through slow,</span> <span m="1999910">gradual, and continuous improvement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2003540">But that doesn't seem to be the way it happened.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005730">There are some characteristics of our species that are</span> <span m="2010210">informative when it comes to guiding the activities of</span> <span m="2014010">people like me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2016120">And here's what the story seems to be</span> <span m="2017950">from the fossil record.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2020600">First of all, we humans have been around for maybe 200,000</span> <span m="2025330">years in our present anatomical form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2029210">If someone walked through the door right now from 200,000</span> <span m="2033140">years ago, I imagine they would be dirty,</span> <span m="2040990">but other than that--</span> <span m="2043750">probably naked, too--</span> <span m="2045100">other than that, you wouldn't be able to tell the</span> <span m="2048070">difference, especially at MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055840">And so the ensuing 150,000 years was a period in which we</span> <span m="2061900">humans didn't actually amount to much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2065159">But somehow, shortly before 50,000 years ago, some small</span> <span m="2070070">group of us developed a capability that separated us</span> <span m="2074500">from all other species.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2077520">It was an accident of evolution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080409">And these accidents may or may not happen, but it happened to</span> <span m="2083310">produce us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085199">It's also the case that we probably necked down as a</span> <span m="2087920">species to a few thousand, or maybe even a few hundred</span> <span m="2090600">individuals, something which made these accidental changes,</span> <span m="2095219">accidental evolutionary products,</span> <span m="2097210">more capable of sticking.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2100500">This leads us to speculate on what it was that happened</span> <span m="2102820">50,000 years ago.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2104750">And paleoanthropologists, Noam Chomsky, a lot of people</span> <span m="2110520">reached similar conclusions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2112580">And that conclusion is--</span> <span m="2115050">I'll quote Chomsky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2116700">He's the voice of authority.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2118990">"It seems that shortly before 50,000 years ago, some small</span> <span m="2122020">group of us acquired the ability to take two concepts,</span> <span m="2126040">and combine them to make a third concept, without</span> <span m="2129020">disturbing the original two concepts, without limit." And</span> <span m="2133540">from a perspective of an AI person like me, what Chomsky</span> <span m="2137110">seems to be saying is, we learned how to begin to</span> <span m="2139490">describe things, in a way that was intimately</span> <span m="2142270">connected with language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2143790">And that, in the end, is what separates us from the</span> <span m="2146360">chimpanzees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2149150">So you might say, well let's just study language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150790">No, you can't do that, because we think with our eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2153580">So language does two things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2155510">Number one, it enables us to make descriptions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2157790">Descriptions enable us to tell stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2160040">And storytelling and story understanding is what all of</span> <span m="2162400">education is about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2163730">That's going up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164810">And going down enables us to marshal the resources of our</span> <span m="2169370">perceptual systems, and even command our perceptual systems</span> <span m="2172950">to imagine things we've never seen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2177450">So here's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2180120">Imagine running down the street with a</span> <span m="2182420">full bucket of water.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2184640">What happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2187810">Your leg gets wet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2189100">The water sloshes out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190780">You'll never find that fact anywhere on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2194600">You've probably never been told that that's what happens</span> <span m="2197470">when you run down the street with a full bucket of water.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199910">But you easily imagine this scenario, and you know what's</span> <span m="2203400">going to happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2203990">There was internal imagination simulation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207150">We're never going to understand human intelligence</span> <span m="2209030">until we can understand that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2211670">Here's another example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2212540">Imagine running down the street with a</span> <span m="2213670">full bucket of nickels?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215620">What happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219460">Nickels weigh a lot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220415">You're going to be bent over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2221395">You're going to stagger.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2223850">But nobody ever told you that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225690">You won't find it anywhere on the web.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2228080">So language is at the center of things because it enables</span> <span m="2230720">storytelling going up, and marshalling the resources of</span> <span m="2234380">the perceptual apparatus, going down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2238240">And that's where we're going to finish the subject the</span> <span m="2240950">semester, by trying to understand more about that</span> <span m="2243320">phenomenon.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2245950">So that concludes everything I wanted to say about the</span> <span m="2248150">material and the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250520">Now I want to turn my attention a little bit to how</span> <span m="2252290">we are going to operate the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2254090">Because there are many characteristics of the subject</span> <span m="2256915">that are confusing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2263610">First of all, we have four kinds of</span> <span m="2266840">activities in the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2297930">And each of these has a different purpose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2319580">So I did the lectures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2320850">And the lectures are supposed to be an hour about</span> <span m="2323910">introducing the material and the big picture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2326740">They're about powerful ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2332138">They're about the experience side of the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2336060">Let me step aside and make a remark.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2339130">MIT is about two things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2340390">It's about skill building, and it's about big ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2346200">So you can build a skill at home, or at Dartmouth, or at</span> <span m="2350120">Harvard, or Princeton, or all those kinds of places.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353830">But the experience you can only get at MIT.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356280">I know everybody there is to know in artificial</span> <span m="2358000">intelligence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2358940">I can tell you about how they think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2360190">I can tell you about how I think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2361250">And that's something you're not going to</span> <span m="2362620">get any other place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2365120">So that's my role, as I see it, in giving these lectures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2369640">Recitations are four buttressing and expanding on</span> <span m="2374160">the material, and providing a venue that's small enough for</span> <span m="2377430">discussion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2380540">Mega recitations are [? a usual ?]</span> <span m="2382200">components of the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2383380">They're taught at the same hour on Fridays.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386230">Mark Seifter, my graduate student,</span> <span m="2388100">will be teaching those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389510">And those are wrapped around past quiz problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393140">And Mark will show you how to work them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2395700">It's very important component to the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400050">And finally the tutorials are about helping</span> <span m="2402400">you with the homework.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2404890">So you might say to me, well, do I really</span> <span m="2409160">need to go to class?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2411590">I like to say that the answer is, only if you like to pass</span> <span m="2415170">the subject.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2417870">But you are MIT students.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2419920">And MIT people always like to look at the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2426150">So this is a scattergram we made after the subject was</span> <span m="2429640">taught last fall, which shows the relationship between</span> <span m="2433010">attendance at lectures and the grades awarded in the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2438680">And if you're not sure what that all means, here's the</span> <span m="2440820">regression line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2446160">So that information is a little suspect for two</span> <span m="2450400">reasons, one of which is we asked people to self report on</span> <span m="2455520">how many lectures they thought they attended.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2458330">And our mechanism for assigning these numerical</span> <span m="2462340">grades is a little weird.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2466560">And there's a third thing, too, and that is, one must</span> <span m="2468470">never confuse correlation with cause.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2472860">You can think of other explanations for why that</span> <span m="2475150">trend line goes up, different from whether it has something</span> <span m="2481230">to do with lectures producing good grades.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2485840">You might ask how I feel about the people up there on the</span> <span m="2488070">other upper left hand corner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490580">There are one or two people who were near the top of the</span> <span m="2492970">subject who didn't go to class at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2497190">And I have mixed feelings about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2500890">You're adults.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2501550">It's your call.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2503460">On the other hand, I wish that if that's what you do</span> <span m="2506490">habitually in all the subjects you take at MIT, that you</span> <span m="2509780">would resign and go somewhere else, and let somebody else</span> <span m="2512450">take their slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2513780">Because you're not benefiting from the powerful ideas, and</span> <span m="2517050">the other kinds of things that involve</span> <span m="2518930">interaction with faculty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521150">So it can be done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2522350">But I don't recommend it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2523310">By the way, all of the four activities that we have here</span> <span m="2526970">show similar regression lines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531280">But what about that five point scale?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2532930">Let me explain how that works to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2534940">We love to have people ask us what the class</span> <span m="2538060">average is on a quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2540430">Because that's when we get to use our blank stare.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543480">Because we have no idea what the class average</span> <span m="2546180">ever is on any quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2548740">Here's what we do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2566110">Like everybody else, we start off with a score</span> <span m="2568660">from zero to 100.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2570680">But then we say to ourselves, what score would you get if</span> <span m="2574750">you had a thorough understanding of the material?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2577260">And we say, well, for this particular exam, it's this</span> <span m="2580400">number right here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582480">And what score would you get if you had a good</span> <span m="2584630">understanding of the material?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2585500">That's that score.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2587340">And what happens if you're down here is that you're</span> <span m="2590040">following off the edge of the range in which we think you</span> <span m="2592670">need to do more work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2594940">So what we do is, we say that if you're in this range here--</span> <span m="2598830">following MIT convention with GPAs and stuff,</span> <span m="2601520">that gets you a five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2603440">If you're in this range down here, there's a</span> <span m="2605300">sharp drop off to four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2608170">If you're in this range down here, there's a</span> <span m="2609710">sharp fall off to three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2613070">So that means if you're in the middle of one of those</span> <span m="2614950">plateaus there's no point in arguing with this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2617790">Because it's not going to do you any good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620550">We have these boundaries where we think performance break</span> <span m="2623020">points are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2625430">So you say, well that seems a little harsh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2627870">Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and start arguing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2629850">But then we will come back with a second major innovation</span> <span m="2633560">we have in the course.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2634860">That is that your grade is calculated in several parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2640300">Part one is the max of your grade on Q1, and</span> <span m="2646970">part one of the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2649830">So in other words, you get two shots at everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2652780">So if you have complete glorious undeniable horrible F</span> <span m="2658080">on the first quiz, it gets erased on the final if you do</span> <span m="2661540">well on that part of the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2663910">So each quiz has a corresponding</span> <span m="2665590">mirror on the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2667080">You get the max of the score you got on those two pieces.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2672680">And now you say to me, I'm an MIT student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2676540">I have a lot of guts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2678066">I'm only going to take the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2684020">It has been done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2686060">We don't recommend it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2689400">And the reason we don't recommend it is that we don't</span> <span m="2691970">expect everybody to do all of the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2693730">So there would be a lot of time pressure if you had to do</span> <span m="2695740">all of the final, all five parts of the final.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2700200">So we have four quizzes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2702890">And the final has a fifth part because there's some material</span> <span m="2705590">that we teach you after the last date on which we can give</span> <span m="2708710">you a final by institute rules.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2711010">But that's roughly how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2712050">And you can read about more of the details in the FAQ on the</span> <span m="2716690">subject homepage.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2719910">So now we're almost done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2721050">I just want to talk a little bit about how we're going to</span> <span m="2724190">communicate with you in the next few days, while we're</span> <span m="2727840">getting ourselves organized.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2729710">So, number one-- if I could ask the TAs to help me pass</span> <span m="2732560">these out--</span> <span m="2734570">we need to schedule you into tutorials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2737890">So we're going to ask you to fill out this form, and give</span> <span m="2739970">it to us before you leave.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2744250">So you'll be hearing from us once we do the sort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2748910">There's the issue of whether we're going to have ordinary</span> <span m="2758100">recitation and a mega recitation this week.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2760500">So pay attention.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761460">Otherwise, you're going to be stranded in a classroom with</span> <span m="2763630">nothing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2764990">We're not going to have any regular recitations this week.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2770010">Are we having regular recitation this week,</span> <span m="2771410">[INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2771720">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2774270">We may, and probably will, have a mega recitation this</span> <span m="2779890">week that's devoted to a Python review.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2784480">Now we know that there are many of you who are</span> <span m="2787810">celebrating a religious holiday on Friday, and so we</span> <span m="2791250">will be putting a lot of resources online so you can</span> <span m="2794680">get that review in another way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2798060">We probably will have a Python review on Friday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2802740">And we ask that you look at our home page for further</span> <span m="2805640">information about that as the week progresses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809520">So that's all folks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2810640">That concludes what we're going to do today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2812470">And as soon as you give us your form, we're through.</span> </p>

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:09,717
PROF.

2
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:12,460
PATRICK WINSTON: Well that's
the Kodo Drummers.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,290
They're a group of about 30 or
40 Japanese people who live in

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,880
a village on some island off
the coast of Japan, and

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,690
preserve traditional
Japanese music.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,830
It's an unusual semi
communal group.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:33,500
They generally run about 10
kilometers before breakfast,

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,730
which is served at 5:00 AM.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,730
Strange group.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,460
Wouldn't miss a concert for
the world, although they,

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,130
alas, don't seem to be
coming down to the

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,970
Boston area very soon.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,130
If you go to a concert
from the Kodo

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,480
Drummers--and you should--

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,880
and if you're no longer young,
you'll want to bring earplugs.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,490
Because, as we humans get
older the dynamic range

17
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,580
control in our inner ear tends
to be less effective.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,900
So that's why a person of my age
might find some piece of

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,960
music excruciatingly loud,
whereas you'll

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,990
think it's just fine.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,200
Because you have better
automatic gain control.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,470
Just like in any kind of
communication device there's a

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,611
control on how intense
the sound gets.

24
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:30,090
Ah, but I go off on a sidebar.

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,310
Many of you have looked
at me in astonishment

26
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,622
as I drink my coffee.

27
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,645
And you have undoubtedly have
been saying to yourself, you

28
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:42,960
know, Winston doesn't look like
a professional athlete,

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,979
but he seemed to have no trouble
drinking his coffee.

30
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,120
So today's material is going
to be pretty easy.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,080
So I want to give you the side
problem of thinking about how

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,830
it's possible for somebody
to do that.

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,509
How is it possible?

34
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:03,140
How would you make a computer
program that could reach out

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,850
and drink a cup of coffee, if
it wanted a cup of coffee?

36
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,370
So that's one puzzle I'd
like you to work on.

37
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,030
There's another puzzle, too.

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,660
And that puzzle concerns
diet drinks.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,070
This is a so-called Diet Coke.

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,920
Yeah, it's ripe.

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,120
If you take a Diet Coke and ask
yourself, what would a dog

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,900
think a Diet Coke is for?

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,730
That's another puzzle that you
can work on while we go

44
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,800
through the material
of the day.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,150
So this is our first lecture
on learning, and I want to

46
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,790
spend a minute or two in the
beginning talking about the

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,990
lay of the land.

48
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,190
And then we'll race through
some material on nearest

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,910
neighbor learning.

50
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,850
And then we'll finish up
with the advertised

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,010
discussion of sleep.

52
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,820
Because I know many of you think
that because your MIT

53
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,370
students you're pretty tough,
and you don't need

54
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,855
to sleep and stuff.

55
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:09,950
And we need to address that
question before it's too late

56
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,320
in the semester to get
back on track.

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,730
All right.

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,720
So here's the story.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,500
Now the way we're going
to look at learning is

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,790
there are two kinds.

61
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,780
There's this kind, and
there's that kind.

62
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,640
And we're going to talk a little
bit about both kinds.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,340
The kind of the right is
learning based on observations

64
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,590
of regularity.

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,190
And computers are particularly
good at this stuff.

66
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,320
And amongst the things that
we'll talk about in connection

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,130
with regularity based learning
are today's topic, which is

68
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,380
nearest neighbors.

69
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,520
Then a little bit downstream
we'll talk about neural nets.

70
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,340
And then somewhere near the end
of the segment, we'll talk

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,900
about boosting.

72
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,209
And these ideas come from
all over the place.

73
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,590
In particular, the stuff we're
talking about today, nearest

74
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,010
neighbors, is the stuff of which
the field of pattern

75
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,260
recognition--

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,690
it's the stuff of which pattern
recognition journals

77
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,909
are filled.

78
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,450
This stuff has been around
a long time.

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,970
Does that mean it's not good?

80
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,850
I hope not, because that would
mean that everything you

81
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,060
learned in 1801 is not good,
because the same course was

82
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,980
taught 1910.

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,950
So it has been around a while,
but it's extremely useful.

84
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,980
And it's the first thing to try
when you have a learning

85
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,570
problem, because it's
the simplest thing.

86
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,200
And you always want to try the
simplest thing before you try

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,480
something more complex that
you will be less likely to

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
understand.

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
So that's nearest neighbors
and pattern recognitions.

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,060
And the custodians of knowledge
about neural nets,

91
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,090
well this is sort of an attempt
to mimic biology.

92
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,370
And I'll cast a lot of calumny
on that when we get down there

93
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,000
to talk about it.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And finally, this is the gift
of the theoreticians.

95
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,550
So we in AI have invented some
stuff, we've borrowed some

96
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,400
stuff, we've stolen some stuff,
we've championed some

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
stuff, and we've improved
some stuff.

98
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,210
That's why our discussion of
learning will reach around all

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,030
of these topics.

100
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,409
So that's regularity
based learning.

101
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:50,100
And you can think of
this as the branch

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,350
of bulldozer computing.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,750
Because, when doing these kinds
of things, a computer's

104
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,426
processing information like a
bulldozer processes gravel.

105
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:04,530
Now that's not necessarily a
good model for all the kinds

106
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,140
of learning that humans do.

107
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,810
And after all, learning is one
of the things that we think

108
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,040
characterizes human
intelligence.

109
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,310
So if we were to build models
of it and understand that we

110
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,800
have to go down this
other branch, too.

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,530
And down this other branch we
find learning ideas that are

112
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,780
based on constraint.

113
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,540
And let's call this the

114
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,140
human-like side of the picture.

115
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,310
And we'll talk about ideas
that enable, for example,

116
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,230
one-shot learning, where you
learn something definite from

117
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,530
each experience.

118
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,300
And we'll talk about explanation
based learning.

119
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:04,930
By the way, do you learn
by self explanation?

120
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,430
I think so.

121
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,220
I had an advisee once, who got
nothing but A's and F's.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,600
And I said, what are the
subjects that you get A's in?

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,420
And why don't you get A's
in all of your subjects?

124
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,360
And he said, oh, I get A's in
the subjects when I convince

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,800
myself the material is true.

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,060
So the learning was a byproduct
of self explanation,

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,720
an important kind of learning.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,860
But alas, that's downstream.

129
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,630
And what we're going to talk
about today is this path

130
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,650
through the tree, nearest
neighbor learning.

131
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,280
And here's how it works,
in general.

132
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,430
Here's just a general picture
of what we're talking about.

133
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,130
When you think of pattern
recognition, or nearest

134
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,870
neighbor based learning,
you've got some sort of

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,940
mechanism that generates
a vector of features.

136
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,475
So we'll call this the
feature detector.

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,652
And out comes a vector
of values.

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,090
And that vector of values
goes into a

139
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,685
comparator of some sort.

140
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,240
And that comparator compares
the feature vector with

141
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,696
feature vectors coming from a
library of possibilities.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,440
And by finding the closest
match the comparator

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,460
determines what some
object is.

144
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,710
It does recognition.

145
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,870
So let me demonstrate that with
these electrical covers.

146
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,580
Suppose they arrived on an
assembly line and some robot

147
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,820
wants to sort them.

148
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,830
How would it go about
doing that?

149
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,080
Well it could easily
use the nearest

150
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,240
neighbor sorting mechanism.

151
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
So how would that work?

152
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,690
Well here's how if would work.

153
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,490
You would make some
measurements.

154
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,310
And it we'll just make some
measurements in two

155
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,950
dimensions.

156
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,030
And one of those measurements
might be the total area,

157
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,780
including the area
of the holes of

158
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,440
these electrical covers.

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,430
Just so you can follow what I'm
doing without craning your

160
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,102
neck, let me see if I can find
the electrical covers.

161
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,040
Yes, there they are.

162
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,080
So we've got one big blank
one, and several others.

163
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,920
So we might also measure
the hole area.

164
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,320
And this one here, this guy
here, this big white one has

165
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,910
no hole area, and its got the
maximum amount of total area.

166
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,410
So it will find itself
at that point in

167
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,590
this space of features.

168
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,710
Then we've got the guy
here, with room for

169
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,330
four sockets in it.

170
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,980
That's got the maximum amount
of hole area, as well as the

171
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,360
maximum amount of area.

172
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,180
So it will be right straight
up, maybe up here.

173
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:20,230
Then we have, in addition to
those two, a blank cover, like

174
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,670
this, that's got about 1/2 the
total area that any cover can

175
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,710
have, so we'll put
it right here.

176
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,560
And finally, we've got one
more of these guys.

177
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,590
Oh yes, this one.

178
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,580
1/2 the hole area, and
1/2 the total area.

179
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,680
So I don't know, let's see.

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,370
Where will that go?

181
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,400
Maybe about right here.

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,330
So now our robot is looking on
the assembly line and it sees

183
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,570
something coming along, and
it measures the area.

184
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,320
And of course, there's noise.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
There's manufacturing
variability.

186
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
So it won't be precisely
on top of anything.

187
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,090
But suppose it's right there.

188
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,820
Well it doesn't take any
genius human, human or

189
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,360
computer, to figure out that
this must be one of those guys

190
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,230
with maximum area and
maximum hole area.

191
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,880
But now let's ask some
other questions.

192
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,595
Where would
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD], what

193
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,460
would that be?

194
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,780
Or what would this be?

195
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,570
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD],
and so on.

196
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:34,980
Well we have to figure out
what those newly viewed

197
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,162
objects are closest to in order
to do an identification.

198
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:40,350
But that's easy.

199
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:46,050
We just calculate the distance
to all of those standard,

200
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,980
platonic, ideal descriptions
of things, and we find out

201
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,790
which is nearest.

202
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,610
But in general, it's a little
easier to think about

203
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:01,580
producing some boundaries
between these various idealize

204
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,530
places, so that we can just
say, well which area

205
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,540
is the object in?

206
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,900
And then we'll know
instantaneously to what

207
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,250
category it belongs.

208
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:15,140
So if we only had two, like the
purple one and the yellow

209
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,880
one, it would be easy.

210
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,520
Because, we would just construct
a line between the

211
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,290
two, with a line between the
purple and yellow as a

212
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,390
perpendicular bisector.

213
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,550
And so drawing it out instead of
talking about it, if there

214
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,270
were only two, that would
be the boundary line.

215
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,270
Anything south of the dotted
line would be purple, and

216
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,180
anything north would
be yellow.

217
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,570
And now we can do this with
all the points, right?

218
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,350
So we can figure out-- oh could
you, Pierre, could you

219
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,800
just close the lap top please?

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,620
So if we want to do this with
all these guys it would go

221
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,390
something like this--

222
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,450
I better get rid of these
dotted x's before

223
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,600
they confuse me.

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,930
Let's see, if these were the
only two points, then we would

225
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,460
want to construct a
perpendicular bisector between

226
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,762
the line joining them.

227
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:13,860
And if these two were the only
points, I would want to

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,060
construct this perpendicular
bisector.

229
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,520
And if these two were the only
points, I would want to

230
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,100
construct a perpendicular
bisector.

231
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,180
And if these two points were
the only ones involved I'd

232
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,960
want to construct--

233
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480
oh, you see what I'm doing?

234
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,410
I'm constructing perpendicular
bisectors, and those are

235
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,520
exactly the lines that
I need in order to

236
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,530
divide up this space.

237
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,070
And it's going to divide
up like this.

238
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,230
And I won't say we'll give you
a problem like this on an

239
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,630
examination, but we have every
year in the past ten.

240
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,310
To divide up a space
and produce--

241
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,730
something we would like
to give a name.

242
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,010
You know, Rumpelstiltskin
effect, when you have a name

243
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,390
you get power over it.

244
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,865
So we're going to call these
decision boundaries.

245
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,760
OK so those are the simple
decision boundaries, produced

246
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,050
in a sample space,
by a simple idea.

247
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:26,030
But there is a little bit
more to say about this.

248
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,450
Because, I've talked about this
as if we're trying to

249
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,510
identify something.

250
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,560
There's another way of thinking
about it that's

251
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,500
extremely important.

252
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,180
And that is this.

253
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,340
Suppose I come in with a brand
new cover, never before seen.

254
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:52,780
And I only measure, well
let's say I only

255
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,710
measure the hole area.

256
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,695
And the hole area
has that value.

257
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,600
What is the most likely
total area?

258
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,060
Well I don't know.

259
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,290
But there's a kind of weak
principle of, if something is

260
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,250
similar in some respects,
it's likely to be

261
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,175
similar in other respects.

262
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:19,100
So I'm going to guess, if you
hold a knife to my throat and

263
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,090
back me into a corner, that it's
total area is going to be

264
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,410
something like that orange
cover whole, total area.

265
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,340
So this is a contrived example,
and I don't make too

266
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,800
much of it.

267
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,910
But I do want to make
a lot of that first

268
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,630
principal, over there.

269
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,200
And that is the idea that, if
something is similar in some

270
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,740
respects, it's likely to be
similar in other respects.

271
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,120
Because that's what most
of education is about.

272
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,990
Fairy tales, legal
cases, medical

273
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,760
cases, business cases--

274
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,170
if you can see that there are
similar in some respects to a

275
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,070
situation you've got now, then
it's likely that they're going

276
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,860
to be similar in other
respects, as well.

277
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,115
So when we're learning, we're
not just learning to recognize

278
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:02,740
a category, we're learning
because we're attempting to

279
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,390
apply some kind of precedent.

280
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,996
That's the story on that.

281
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:11,590
Well that's a simple idea but
does it have any application?

282
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,810
The answer is sure.

283
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,470
Here's an example.

284
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,730
My second example, the example
of cell identification.

285
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,060
Suppose you have some
white blood cells,

286
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,310
what might you do?

287
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,960
You might measure the total
area of the cell.

288
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,340
And not the hole area, but
maybe the nucleus area.

289
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,685
And maybe you might measure four
or five other things, and

290
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:38,300
put this thing in a high
dimensional space.

291
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,860
You can still measure
the nearness in a

292
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,700
high dimensional space.

293
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,020
So you can use the
idea to do that.

294
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,780
It works pretty well.

295
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,940
A friend of mine once started a
company based on this idea.

296
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,490
He got wiped out, of course,
but it wasn't his fault.

297
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,670
What happened is that somebody
invented a better stain and it

298
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,670
became much easier
to just do the

299
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,030
recognition by brute force.

300
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,840
So let's see, that's
two examples.

301
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,770
the introductory example of the
holes of the electrical

302
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,810
covers, and the example
of cells.

303
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,170
And what I want to do now is
show you how the idea can

304
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,940
reappear in disguised forms in
areas where you might not

305
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,010
expect to see it.

306
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,310
So consider the following
problem.

307
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:29,070
You have a collection of
articles from magazines.

308
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:34,060
And you're interested in
learning something about how

309
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,920
to address a particular
question.

310
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,510
How do you go about finding the
articles that are relevant

311
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,420
to your question?

312
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:46,170
So this is a puzzle that has
been studied for decades by

313
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,900
people interested in information
retrieval.

314
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,390
And here's the simple
way to do it.

315
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,010
I'm going to illustrate, once
again, in just two dimensions.

316
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,840
But it has to be applied in
many, many dimensions.

317
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,930
The idea is you count up the
words in the articles in your

318
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,370
library, and you compare the
word counts to the word counts

319
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,870
in your probing question.

320
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,480
So you might be interested
in 100 words.

321
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,990
I'm only going to write two on
the board for illustration.

322
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,850
So we're going to think about
articles from two magazines.

323
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,500
Well first of all, what words
are we going to use?

324
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,160
One word is going to be hack,
and that will include all

325
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,550
derivatives of hack-- hacker,
hacking, and so on.

326
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,550
And the other word is going
to be computer.

327
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,250
And so it would not be
surprising for you to see that

328
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,480
articles from Wired Magazine
might appear

329
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,790
in places like this.

330
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,320
They would involve lots of uses
of the word computer, and

331
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,670
lots of uses of the word hack.

332
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,180
And now for the sake of
illustration, the second

333
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,680
magazine from which we are going
to draw articles is Town

334
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,700
and Country.

335
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,830
It's a very tony magazine, and
the people who read out Town

336
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,360
and Country tend to be
social parasites.

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,930
And they still use
the word hack.

338
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,330
Because you can talk about
hacking, there's some sort of

339
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,080
specialize term of art in
dealing with horses.

340
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,760
So all the Town and Country
articles would be likely to be

341
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,980
down here somewhere.

342
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,110
And maybe they would be one like
that when they talk about

343
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,960
hiring some computer expert to
keep track of the results so

344
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,940
the weekly hunt, or something.

345
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,950
And now, in you come
with your probe.

346
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,430
And of course your probe
question is going to be

347
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,220
relatively small.

348
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,510
It's not going to have
a lot of words in it.

349
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,640
So here's your here's
your probe question.

350
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,890
Here's your unknown.

351
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,840
Which article's going
to be closest?

352
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,944
Which articles are going
to be closest?

353
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:22,580
Well, alas, all those Town and
Country articles are closest.

354
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,520
So you can't use the nearest
neighbor idea, it would seem.

355
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,230
Anybody got a suggestion
for how we might

356
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,570
get out of this dilemma?

357
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,286
Yes, Christopher.

358
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:35,087
CHRISTOPHER: If you're looking
for word counts and you want

359
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:38,248
to include some terms of
computer, then wouldn't you

360
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,743
want to use that as a threshold,
rather than the

361
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:41,741
nearest neighbor?

362
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:41,824
PROF.

363
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:42,740
PATRICK WINSTON: I don't
know, it's a good idea.

364
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,492
It might work, who knows.

365
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:47,486
Doug?

366
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:50,965
DOUG: Instead of using decision
boundaries that are

367
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:55,530
perpendicular bisectors, if you
treated Wired and Town and

368
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,434
Country as sort of this
like, [INAUDIBLE]

369
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,410
targets.

370
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,338
And they would look like some
[? great radial ?], here.

371
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,290
I guess, some radius
around curves.

372
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,730
If it's within a certain
radius then--

373
00:21:11,634 --> 00:21:11,756
PROF.

374
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:13,098
PATRICK WINSTON: Yes?

375
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,806
[? SPEAKER 1: Are we, ?]
necessarily, have it done with

376
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,026
some sort of a
[? politidy distance ?]

377
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:16,550
metric?

378
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:16,640
PROF.

379
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,650
PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, here we go.

380
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,114
We're not going to use any
[? politidy distance ?]

381
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:19,602
metric.

382
00:21:19,602 --> 00:21:21,066
We're going to use some
other metric.

383
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:22,042
SPEAKER 1: Like alogrithmic,
or whatnot?

384
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:22,164
PROF.

385
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,018
PATRICK WINSTON: Well,
algorithmic,

386
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:24,482
gees, I don't know.

387
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,440
[LAUGHTER]

388
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,478
PROF.

389
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:29,040
PATRICK WINSTON: Let
me give you a hint.

390
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,880
Let me give you a hint.

391
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,720
There are all those articles up
there, out there, and out

392
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,045
there, just for example.

393
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:41,060
And here are the Town and
Country articles.

394
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,210
They're out there, and out
there, for example.

395
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,050
And now our unknown
is out there.

396
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,020
Anybody got an idea now?

397
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,110
Hey Brett, what do you think?

398
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,870
BRETT: So you sort of
want the ratio.

399
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,640
Or in this case, you can
take the angle--

400
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:58,707
PROF.

401
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,270
PATRICK WINSTON: Let's be-- ah,
there we go, we're getting

402
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,060
a little more sophisticated.

403
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,320
The angle between what?

404
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,260
BRETT: The angle between
the vectors.

405
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,381
PROF.

406
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:06,715
PATRICK WINSTON: The vectors.

407
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,170
Good.

408
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,140
So we're going to use
a different metric.

409
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,485
What we're going to do is,
we're going to forget

410
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:12,810
including a distance, and we're
going to measure the

411
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,150
angle between the vectors.

412
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,460
So the angle between the
vectors, well let's actually

413
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,960
measure the cosine of the angle
between the vectors.

414
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,180
Let's see how we can
calculate that.

415
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,970
So we'll take the cosine of the
angle between the vectors,

416
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,570
we'll call it theta.

417
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:37,960
That's going to be equal to the
sum of the unknown values

418
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,660
times the article values.

419
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,290
Those are just the values
in various dimensions.

420
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,660
And then we'll divide that
by the magnitude

421
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,550
of the other vectors.

422
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,430
So we'll divide by the magnitude
of u, and we'll

423
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,290
divide by the magnitude of the
art vector to the article.

424
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,050
So that's just the dot
product right?

425
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,860
That's a very fast
computation.

426
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,075
So with a very fast computation
you can see if

427
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:10,250
these things are going to be
in the same direction.

428
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,670
By the way, if this vector here
is actually identical to

429
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,980
one of those articles, what
will the value be?

430
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,366
Well then a cosine will be 0 and
we'll get the maximum die

431
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,616
of the cosine, which is 1.

432
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,540
Yeah, that will do it.

433
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,900
So if we use any of the articles
to probe the article

434
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,230
space, they'll find themselves,
which is a good

435
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,080
thing to have a mechanism do.

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,560
OK.

437
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,300
So that's just the dot product
of those two vectors.

438
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,220
And it works like a charm.

439
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,830
It's not the most sophisticated
way of doing

440
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,620
these things.

441
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,150
There are hairy ways.

442
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,370
You can get a Ph.D. by doing
this sort of stuff in some new

443
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,510
and sophisticated way.

444
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,230
But this is a simple way.

445
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,830
It works pretty well.

446
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,080
And you don't have to strain
yourself, much,

447
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,990
to implement it.

448
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,700
So that's cool.

449
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,220
That's an example where
we have a very

450
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,470
non-standard metric.

451
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,190
Now let's see, what
else can we do?

452
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,980
How about a robotic
arm control?

453
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,430
Here we go.

454
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,790
We're going to just
have a simple arm.

455
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,820
And what we want to do is, we
want to get this arm to move

456
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,200
that ball along some trajectory
at a speed,

457
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,040
velocity, and acceleration
that we have determined.

458
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,320
So we've got two
problems here.

459
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,780
Well let's see, we've got two
problems because, first of

460
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,374
all, we've got angles,
theta 1 and theta 2.

461
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:04,470
It's a 2 degree of 3 of arm, so
there are only two angles.

462
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,220
So the first problem we have
is the kinematic problem of

463
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,590
translating the (x,y)-cordinates
of the ball,

464
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,660
the desired ones, into the
theta 1, theta 2 space.

465
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,630
That's simple kinematic
problem.

466
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,680
No f equals ma there.

467
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,110
It Doesn't involve forces,
or time, or

468
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,240
acceleration, anything.

469
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,680
Pretty simple.

470
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,990
But then we've got the problem
of getting it to go along that

471
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,690
trajectory with positions,
speeds, and

472
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,230
accelerations that we desire.

473
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:48,710
And now you say to me, well I've
got 801, I can do that.

474
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,920
And that's true, you can.

475
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,480
Because, it's Newtonian
mechanics.

476
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,810
All you have to do is
solve the equations.

477
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,810
There are the equations.

478
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,060
Good luck.

479
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,940
Why are they so complicated?

480
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,655
Well because of the complicated
geometry.

481
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:18,850
You notice we've got some
products of theta 1 and theta

482
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,170
2 in there, somewhere,
I think?

483
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,210
You've got theta 2's.

484
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,570
I see an acceleration squared.

485
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,080
And yeah, there's a theta 1
dot times a theta 2 dot.

486
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,520
A velocity times a velocity.

487
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,530
Where the hell did
that come from?

488
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,970
I mean it's supposed to
be f equals ma, right?

489
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,600
Those are Coriolis forces,
because of

490
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,690
the complicated geometry.

491
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:37,950
OK.

492
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,440
So you hire Berthold Horn, or
somebody, to work these

493
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,210
equations out for you.

494
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,590
And he comes up with something
like this.

495
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,090
And you try it out and
it doesn't work.

496
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,175
Why doesn't it work?

497
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:47,772
It's Newtonian mechanics,
I said.

498
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,480
It doesn't work because we
forgot to tell Berthold that

499
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,860
there's friction in
all the joints.

500
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,800
And we forgot to tell him that
they've worn a little bit

501
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,470
since yesterday.

502
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,150
And we forgot that the
measurements we make on the

503
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,500
lab table are not
quite precise.

504
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,580
So people try to do this.

505
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,360
It just doesn't work.

506
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,270
As soon as you get a ball of a
different weight you have to

507
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,820
start over.

508
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,310
It's gross.

509
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,560
So I don't know.

510
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,990
I can do this sort of thing
effortlessly, and I couldn't

511
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,590
begin to solve those
equations.

512
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,410
So let's see.

513
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,940
What we're going to do is we're
going to forget about

514
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,310
the problem for a minute.

515
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,030
And we're going to talk
about building

516
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,180
ourselves a gigantic table.

517
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,570
And here's what's going
to be on the table.

518
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,610
Theta 1, theta 2, theta 3,
oops, there are only two.

519
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,960
So that's theta 1 again,
but it's the

520
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,260
velocity, angular velocity.

521
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,570
And then we have the
accelerations.

522
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,685
So we're going to have a big
table of these things.

523
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,780
And what we're going to
do, is we're going to

524
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,140
give this arm a childhood.

525
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,270
And we're going to write down
all the combinations we ever

526
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,940
see, every 100 milliseconds,
or something.

527
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,947
And the arm is just going to
wave around like a kid does in

528
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:13,160
the cradle.

529
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,350
And then, we're not
quite done.

530
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,660
Because there are two other
things we're going to record.

531
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,410
Can you guess what they are?

532
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,317
There are going to be the torque
on the first motor, and

533
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:25,839
the torque on the
second motor.

534
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,710
And so now, we've got a whole
bunch of those records.

535
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,960
The question is, what do
we got to do with it?

536
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,620
Well here's what we're
going to do it.

537
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,200
We're going to divide this
trajectory that we're hoping

538
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,370
to achieve, up into
little pieces.

539
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,580
And there's a little piece.

540
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,860
And in that little
piece nothing is

541
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,420
going to change much.

542
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,960
There's going to be an

543
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,770
acceleration, velocity, position.

544
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,000
And so we can look those
up in the table that

545
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,892
we made in the childhood.

546
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:08,360
And we'll look around and find
the closest match, and this

547
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,960
will be the set of values for
the positions, velocities, and

548
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,230
accelerations that are
associated with that

549
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,880
particular movement.

550
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,200
And guess what we can do now?

551
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,460
We can say, in the past, the
torques associated with that

552
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,650
particular little piece of
movement lie right there.

553
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,950
So we can just look it up.

554
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,690
Now this method was thought
up and rejected, because

555
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,690
computers weren't
powerful enough.

556
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,170
And then, this is the age
of recycling, right?

557
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,625
So the idea got recycled when
computers got strong enough.

558
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:46,336
And it works pretty well,
for things like this.

559
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:51,040
But you might say to me, well
can it do the stuff that we

560
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,620
humans can do, like this?

561
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,010
And the answer is, let's look.

562
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,820
So this is a training
phase, it's

563
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,070
going through its childhood.

564
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,940
You see what's happening
is this.

565
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,200
The initial table won't
be very good.

566
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,330
But that's OK.

567
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,950
Because there are only a small
number of things that it's

568
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,600
important for you to
be able to do.

569
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,450
So when you try those
things it's still

570
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,340
writing into the table.

571
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,660
So the next time you try that
particular motion, it's going

572
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,800
to be better at it, because
its got better stuff to

573
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,810
interpolate [? amongst ?]

574
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,300
in that table.

575
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,290
So that's why this thing is
getting better and better as

576
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,540
it goes on.

577
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,500
That's as good as I was doing.

578
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:38,830
Pretty good, don't you think?

579
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,460
There's just one thing I want
to show at the end of this

580
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,820
clip just for fun.

581
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,470
Maybe you've seen some
old Zorro movies?

582
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,370
So here's a little set up where
this thing has learned

583
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,680
to use a lash.

584
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,220
So here's the lash, and there's
a candle down there.

585
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,470
So watch this.

586
00:32:11,325 --> 00:32:13,160
Pretty good, don't you think?

587
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,840
So how fast does the learning
take place?

588
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,820
Let me go back to that other
slides and show you.

589
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,790
So here's some graphs to show
you how fast goes, boom.

590
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,620
That gives you the curves of how
well the robot arm can go

591
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,290
along a straight line, after
no practice with just some

592
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,200
stuff recorded in the memory.

593
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,270
And then with a couple of
practice runs do give it

594
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,120
better values amongst which
to interpolate.

595
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,170
So I think that's pretty cool.

596
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,630
So simple, but yet
so effective.

597
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,720
But you still might say, well,
I don't know, it might be

598
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,280
something that can be done
in special cases.

599
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,230
I wonder if old Winston uses
something like that when he

600
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,470
drinks his coffee?

601
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,610
Well we' ought to
do the numbers

602
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,050
and see if it's possible.

603
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,190
But I don't want to
use coffee, it's

604
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,740
the baseball season.

605
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,180
We're approaching the
World Series.

606
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,410
We might as well talk about
professional athletes.

607
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,320
So let's suppose that this
is a baseball pitcher.

608
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,620
And I want to know how much
memory I'll need to record a

609
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,590
whole lot of pitches.

610
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,040
Is there a good pitcher
these days?

611
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,710
The Red Socks suck so I
don't do Red Socks.

612
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,240
Clay Buchholz, I guess.

613
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,560
I don't know, some pitcher.

614
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,380
And what we're going to do, is
we're going to say for each of

615
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,890
these little segments
were going to record

616
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:46,990
100 bytes per joint.

617
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,980
And we've got joints
all over the place.

618
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,230
I don't know how many are
involved in doing a baseball

619
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:58,170
pitch, but let's just say
we have had 100 joints.

620
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,840
And then we have to divide
the pitch up

621
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,800
into a bunch of segments.

622
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,470
So let's just say for sake
of argument that

623
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:15,219
there are 100 segments.

624
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:20,560
And how many pitches does a
pitcher throw in a day?

625
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:20,879
What?

626
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:21,675
SPEAKER 2: In a day?

627
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:21,754
PROF.

628
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:25,010
PATRICK WINSTON:
In a day, yeah.

629
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,330
This, we all know,
is about 100.

630
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,610
Everybody knows that
they take them out

631
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:37,210
after about 100 pitches.

632
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,330
So what I want to know is how
much memory we need to record

633
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,000
all the pitches a pitcher
pitches in his career.

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,060
So we still have to work on
this little bit more.

635
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,000
How many days a year does
a pitcher pitch?

636
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,750
Well, they've got winter ball,
and that sort of thing, so

637
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:56,938
let's just approximate
it as 100.

638
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:59,070
I don't know, some of these may
be a little high, some of

639
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,430
the others may be a low.

640
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,650
And of course, the career--

641
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,524
just to make things easy--

642
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:07,940
is 100 years.

643
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,000
So that's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,110
So we have 10 to
the 12th bytes.

645
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,340
Is that the hopelessly
big to store in here?

646
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,080
CHRISTOPHER: 10 to 100
[INAUDIBLE] or

647
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,460
just 100 times throwing?

648
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:25,495
PROF.

649
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:27,470
PATRICK WINSTON: 100
pitches in a day--

650
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,860
Christopher's asking
some detail--

651
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,790
and what we're gong to do
is we're going to record

652
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,270
everything there is to know
about one pitch, and then

653
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,472
we're going to see how
many pitches, he

654
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:35,890
pitches in his lifetime.

655
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,140
And we're going to
record all that.

656
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,444
Trust me.

657
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:43,805
Trust me.

658
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:47,800
OK. so we want to know if this
is actually a practical scale.

659
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,640
And this, by the way, is
cocktail conversation, who

660
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,330
knows, right?

661
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,170
But it's useful to work out
these numbers, and know some

662
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,780
of these numbers.

663
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,690
So the question we have
to ask is, how much

664
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,010
computation is in there?

665
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,240
And the first question relevant
to that is, how many

666
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,760
neurons do we have
in our brain?

667
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,650
Volunteer?

668
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,740
Neuroscience?

669
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,580
No one to volunteer?

670
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:15,970
All right.

671
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,690
Well this is a number you should
know, because this is

672
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,990
what you've got in there.

673
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:29,870
There are 10 to the 10th neurons
in the brain, of which

674
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,990
10 to the 11th are in the
cerebellum, alone.

675
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,670
What the devil do
I mean by that?

676
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,390
I mean that your cerebellum is
so full of neurons that it

677
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,610
dwarfs the rest of the brain.

678
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,440
So if you exclude the
cerebellum, you've got about

679
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,380
10 to 10th neurons.

680
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,020
And there about 10 to
the 11th neurons in

681
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,750
the cerebellum, alone.

682
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,610
What's the cerebellum for?

683
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,210
Motor control.

684
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,380
Interesting.

685
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,690
So we're a little short.

686
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,170
Oh, but we forget, that's just
the number of neurons.

687
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:04,630
We have to count up the
number of synapses.

688
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,060
Because conceivably, we might
be able to adjust those

689
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,650
synapses, right?

690
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,670
So how many synapses
does a neuron have?

691
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,020
The answer is, it depends.

692
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,855
But the ones in the
cerebellum--

693
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,990
I should be pointing back
there, I guess--

694
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,550
10 to the 5th.

695
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:31,970
So if we add all that up
we have 10 to the 16th.

696
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,220
No problem.

697
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,950
It's just that existence proves
that you don't have to

698
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,470
worry too much about
having storage.

699
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,100
So maybe our cerebellum
functions, in some way, as a

700
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,150
gigantic table.

701
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,240
And that's maybe how we learn
motor skills, by filling up

702
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,700
that table as we run around
emerging from the cradle,

703
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,770
learning how to manipulate
ourselves as we go on.

704
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,440
So that's the story
on arm control.

705
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,320
Now all this is pretty
straightforward, easy to

706
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,430
understand.

707
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,515
And of course, there
are some problems.

708
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:34,660
Problem number one, what
if the space of

709
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,586
samples looks like this?

710
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:42,420
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD]

711
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,400
What's going to happen
in that case?

712
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,870
Well what's going to happen
in that case is that the--

713
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,595
let's see, which values are
going to be more important?

714
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,160
The x values, right?

715
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,000
The y values are spread out
all over the place.

716
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,470
So you'd like the spread of
the data to sort of be the

717
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,820
same in all the dimensions.

718
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,650
So is there anything we
can do to arrange

719
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,710
for that to be true?

720
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,820
Sure, we can just normalize
the data.

721
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,470
So we can borrow from our
statistics course and say,

722
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,040
well, let's see, we're
interested in x.

723
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,250
And we know that the variance
of x is equal to 1 over n

724
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:35,170
times the sum of the values,
minus the mean value squared.

725
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,090
That's a measure of how much
the data spreads out.

726
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:43,990
So now, instead of using x, we
can use x prime, which is

727
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:51,380
equal to x over sigma.

728
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,120
What's the variance of
that going to be?

729
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,000
x over sigma sub x.

730
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,820
Anybody see, instantaneously,
what the variance of

731
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,630
that's going be?

732
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,980
Or do we have to work it out?

733
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,250
It's going to be 1, Work
out the algebra for me.

734
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,470
It's obvious, it's simple.

735
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:17,150
Just substitute x prime into
this formula for variance, and

736
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,545
do the algebraic high
school manipulation.

737
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,720
And you'll see that the variance
turns out not to be

738
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,750
of this new variable, this
transformed variable you want.

739
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,100
So that problem, the non
uniformity problem, the spread

740
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,920
problem, is easy to handle.

741
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,260
What about that other problem?

742
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,090
No cake without flour?

743
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,050
What if it turns out
that the data--

744
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,470
you have two dimensions and the
answer, actually, doesn't

745
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,250
depend on y at all.

746
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,500
What will happen?

747
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,680
Then you're often going to get
screwy results, because it'll

748
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,450
be measuring a distance
that is merely

749
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,510
confusing the answer.

750
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,160
So problem number two is the
what matters problem.

751
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,618
Write it down, what matters.

752
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,440
Problem number three is, what
if the answer doesn't depend

753
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,540
on the data at all?

754
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,360
Then you've got the trying to
build a cake without flour.

755
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,430
Once somebody asked me--

756
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,030
a classmate of mine, who went
on to become an important

757
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,210
executive in an important credit
card company-- asked me

758
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,780
if we could use artificial
intelligence to determine when

759
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,280
somebody was going
to go bankrupt?

760
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,220
And the answer was, no.

761
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,930
Because the data available was
data that was independent of

762
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,990
that question.

763
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,100
So he was trying to make a cake
without flour, and you

764
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,210
can't do that.

765
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,300
So that concludes what
I want to say

766
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,040
about nearest neighbors.

767
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,750
No I want to talk a little
bit about sleep.

768
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,010
Over there on that left-side
branch, now disappeared, we

769
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,750
talked about the human
side of learning.

770
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,250
And I said something
about one-shot, an

771
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,390
escalation based learning.

772
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,110
And what that means is,
you don't learn

773
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,000
without problem solving.

774
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,950
And the question is, how is
problem solving related to how

775
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,910
much sleep you get?

776
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,330
And to answer questions like
that, of course, you want to

777
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,420
go to the people who are the
custodians of the kind of

778
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,870
knowledge you are
interested in.

779
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,980
And so you would say, who are
the custodians of knowledge

780
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,690
about how much sleep you need?

781
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,910
And what happens if
you don't get it?

782
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,020
And the answer is the
United States Army.

783
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,170
Because they're extremely
interested in what happens

784
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,516
when you cross 10 or 12 times
zones, and have no sleep, and

785
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,600
have to perform.

786
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,090
So they're very interested
in that question.

787
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,730
And they got even more
interested after the first

788
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:12,720
Gulf War, which was the
most studied war in

789
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,890
history, up to that time.

790
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,750
Because, there were after action
reports they were full

791
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,490
of examples like this.

792
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:26,750
The US Forces, in a certain part
of the battlefield, and

793
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,680
drawn up for the night.

794
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,040
And those are Bradley fighting
vehicles, there, and back here

795
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,430
Abrams tanks.

796
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,770
And they're all just kind
of settling down for

797
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,760
good night's sleep.

798
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,110
They've been up for about 36
hours straight, by the way.

799
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:48,940
When, much to their amazement,
across their field-of-view

800
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,720
came a column of
Iraqi vehicles.

801
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,240
And both sides were enormously
surprised.

802
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,830
A firefight broke out.

803
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,600
The lead vehicle, over
here, on the Iraqi

804
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,970
side caught on fire.

805
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,110
So these guys, in the Bradley
fighting vehicles, went around

806
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,370
to investigate, whereupon, these
guys started blasting

807
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:17,590
away, in acts of fratricidal
fire.

808
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:23,450
And the interesting thing is
that all these folks here

809
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,160
swore in the after action
reports that they were firing

810
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,430
straight ahead.

811
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,330
And what happened was their
ability to put ordnance on

812
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,205
target was not impaired
at all.

813
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:36,090
But their idea of where the
target was, what the target

814
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,100
was, whether it was a target,
was all screwed up.

815
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,950
So this led to a lot of
experiments in which people

816
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:44,810
were sleep deprived.

817
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,150
And by the way, you think
you're a tough

818
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,020
MIT student, right?

819
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,500
These are Army Rangers.

820
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,850
It doesn't get any tougher
than this, believe me.

821
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:52,780
So here's one of the

822
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,290
experiments that was performed.

823
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,740
In those days they had
what they called

824
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,110
fire control teams.

825
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,820
And their job is to take
information from an observer,

826
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,780
over here, about a target,
over here.

827
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:18,880
And tell the artillery, over
here, where to fire.

828
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,170
So they kept some of
these folks up

829
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,020
for 36 hours straight.

830
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,780
And after 36 hours they all
said, we're doing great.

831
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,620
And at that time they were
bringing fire down on

832
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:35,360
hospitals, mosques, churches,
schools, and themselves.

833
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,500
Because, they couldn't do the
calculations anymore, after 36

834
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,310
hours without sleep.

835
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,430
And now you say to me, well I'm
a MIT student, I want to

836
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,070
see the data.

837
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,390
So let's have a look
at the data.

838
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,180
OK.

839
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,090
So there it goes.

840
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:11,730
That's what happens to you after
72 hours without sleep.

841
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,000
These are simple things to do.

842
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,910
Very simple calculations you
have to do in your head, like

843
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:21,730
adding numbers, spelling words,
and things like that.

844
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:24,400
So after 72 hours without
sleep, your performance

845
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,860
relative to what you were at
the beginning is about 30%.

846
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,825
So loss of sleep destroys
ability.

847
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:48,900
[BELL RINGING]

848
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,390
Sleep loss accumulates.

849
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,830
So you say, well I need
eight hours of sleep--

850
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,145
and what you need, by
the way, varies--

851
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,220
but I'm going to get by was
seven hours of sleep.

852
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,830
So after 20 days of one hour's
worth of sleep deprivation,

853
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,740
you're down about 25%.

854
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,660
If you say, well I need eight
hours of sleep, but I'm going

855
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,470
to have to get by with just six,
after 20 days of that,

856
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:19,450
you're down to about 25% of
your original capability.

857
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,390
So you might say, well
does caffeine help?

858
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,950
Or naps, naps in this case.

859
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,300
And the answer is, yes,
a little bit.

860
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,790
Some people argue that you get
the more affect out of the

861
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,620
sleep that you do get if
you divide it into two.

862
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,640
Winston Churchill always
took a three

863
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,580
hour nap in the afternoon.

864
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,080
He said that way he got a day
and a half's worth of work out

865
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,740
of every day.

866
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,930
He got the full amount
of sleep.

867
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,630
But he divided it
into two pieces.

868
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,140
Here's the caffeine one.

869
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,430
So caffeine does help.

870
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,680
And now you say, well, shoot,
I think I'm going to take it

871
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,710
kind of easy this semester.

872
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,100
And I'll just work hard during
the week before finals.

873
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,550
Maybe I won't even bother
sleeping for the 24 hours

874
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,754
before the 6034 final.

875
00:48:04,754 --> 00:48:05,920
That's OK.

876
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,170
Well let's see what
will happen.

877
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,930
So let's work the numbers.

878
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,240
Here is 24 hours.

879
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,260
And that's where your

880
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,370
effectiveness is after 24 hours.

881
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,710
Now let's go over to the same
amount of effectiveness on the

882
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,910
blood alcohol curve.

883
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,290
And it's about the level
at which you

884
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:28,880
would be legally drunk.

885
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,370
So I guess what we ought to do
is to check everybody as they

886
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,040
come in for the 6034 final, and
arrest you if you've been

887
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,970
24 hours without sleep.

888
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,850
And not let you take any finals
again, for a year.

889
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:46,710
So if you do all that, you
might as well get drunk.

890
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,400
And now we have one thing
left to do today.

891
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
And that is address the original
question of, why it

892
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,520
is that the dogs and cats in the
world think that the diet

893
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,400
drink makes people fat?

894
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,600
What's the answer?

895
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,160
It's because only fat guys
like me drink this crap.

896
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,580
So since the dogs and cats don't
have the ability to tell

897
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,430
themselves stories, don't have
that capacity to string

898
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:14,870
together events into narratives,
they don't have

899
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,230
any way of saying, well this is
a consequence of desiring

900
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,110
not to be fat.

901
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,870
Not a consequence
of being fat.

902
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,970
They don't have that story.

903
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,810
And so what they're doing is
something you have to be very

904
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:26,450
careful about.

905
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,630
And that thing you have to be
very careful about is the

906
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,930
confusion of correlation
with cause.

907
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,040
They see the correlation, but
they don't understand the

908
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,660
cause, so that's why they
make a mistake.

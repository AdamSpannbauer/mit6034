<p><strong>Description:</strong> To determine whether three blocks form an arch, we use a model which evolves through examples and near misses; this is an example of one-shot learning. We also discuss other aspects of how students learn, and how to package your ideas better.</p> <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Patrick H. Winston</p>

<p><span m="10870">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: You know, some</span> <span m="13000">of you who for instance--</span> <span m="15406">I don't know, Sonya, Krishna, Shoshana--</span> <span m="22240">some of you I can count on being here every time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="24390">Some of you show up once in a while.</span> </p>
<p><span m="25710">The ones of you who show up once in a while happen to be</span> <span m="27650">very lucky if you picked today, because what we're</span> <span m="29320">going to do today is I'm going to tell you stuff that might</span> <span m="32350">make a big difference in your whole life.</span> </p>
<p><span m="34850">Because I'm going to tell you how you can</span> <span m="35870">make yourself smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="37810">No kidding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="38610">And I'm also going to tell you how you can package your ideas</span> <span m="41730">so you'll be the one that's picked instead</span> <span m="43610">of some other slug.</span> </p>
<p><span m="45660">So that's what we're going to do today.</span> </p>
<p><span m="48240">It's the most important lecture of the semester.</span> </p>
<p><span m="52450">The sleep lecture is only the second most important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="54850">This is the most important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="57300">Now the vehicle that's going to get us there is a</span> <span m="59740">discussion about how it's possible to learn in a way</span> <span m="64170">that is a little reminiscent of what we</span> <span m="66110">talked about last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="67540">Because last time we learned something very definite from a</span> <span m="70120">small number of examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="71289">This takes it one step further and shows how it's possible to</span> <span m="75220">learn in a human-like way from a single example in one shot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="80830">So it's extremely different, very different from everything</span> <span m="84880">you've seen before.</span> </p>
<p><span m="86270">Everything that involves learning from thousands of</span> <span m="92050">trials and gazillions of examples and only learning a</span> <span m="97340">little tiny bit, if anything, from each of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="99300">This is going to learn something</span> <span m="100550">definite from every example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106400">So here's the classroom example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="109400">What's this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="110080">It's an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="111090">I know the architects are complaining that it's not an</span> <span m="114330">arch in architecture land.</span> </p>
<p><span m="117150">It's a post and lintel construction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="119340">But for us today it's going to be an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="121780">Now if you were from Mars and didn't know what an arch was,</span> <span m="124700">I might present this to you and you'd get a general idea</span> <span m="127610">of some things that might be factors, but you'd have no</span> <span m="130020">idea what's really important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="132230">So then I would say, that's not an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="135040">And you would learn something very definite from that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="137900">And then I would shove these together and put this back on,</span> <span m="140470">and I would say, that's not an arch either.</span> </p>
<p><span m="142690">And you'd learn something very definite from that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145470">And then I could paint the top one blue, and you'd learn</span> <span m="148530">something very different from that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="149920">And how can that happen is the question?</span> </p>
<p><span m="153050">How can that happen in detail, and what might it mean for</span> <span m="158130">human learning and how you can make yourself smarter?</span> </p>
<p><span m="160780">And that's where we're going to go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="162350">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="163020">So how can we make a program that's a smart as a martian</span> <span m="166620">about learning things like that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="169610">Well, if you were writing that program, surely the first</span> <span m="172020">thing you would do is you'd try to get off the picture as</span> <span m="175710">quickly as possible and into symbol land where things are</span> <span m="179870">clearer about what the important parts are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="183430">So you'd be presented with an initial example that might</span> <span m="188120">look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="194630">We'll call that an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="199750">And it's more than just an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="201079">It's the initial model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="207829">That's the starting point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="209900">And now we're going to couple that with something that's not</span> <span m="212470">actually an arch but looks a whole lot like one, at least</span> <span m="218710">on the descriptive level to which we're about to go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="221530">So here's something that's not an arch, but its description</span> <span m="227590">doesn't differ from that of an arch very much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="230430">In fact, if we were to draw this out in a kind of network,</span> <span m="234262">we would have a description that looks like this, and</span> <span m="237780">these relations would be support relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="243280">And this would be drawn out like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="247640">And the only difference would be--</span> <span m="250640">the only difference would be that those support relations</span> <span m="252950">that we had in the initial model--</span> <span m="257570">the example--</span> <span m="259060">have disappeared down out here in this configuration.</span> </p>
<p><span m="265100">But since it's not very different from the model,</span> <span m="266790">we're going to call this a near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="276630">And now, you see, we've abstracted away from all the</span> <span m="279670">details that don't matter to us.</span> </p>
<p><span m="281800">Last time we talked about a good representation having</span> <span m="284000">certain qualities--</span> <span m="284970">qualities like making the right things explicit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="287050">Well, this makes the structure explicit, and it suppresses</span> <span m="290300">information about blemishes on the surface.</span> </p>
<p><span m="293159">We don't care much about how tall the objects are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="296540">We don't think it matters what they're made of.</span> </p>
<p><span m="300180">So this is a representation that satisfies the first of</span> <span m="303050">the criteria from last time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="304210">It makes the right things explicit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="307830">And by making the right things explicit, it's exposing some</span> <span m="310990">constraint here with respect to what it</span> <span m="312440">takes to be an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="313370">And we see that if those support relations are missing,</span> <span m="316460">it's not an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="318410">So we ought to be able to learn something from that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="323870">What we're going to do is we're going to put these two</span> <span m="325170">things together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="327170">We're going to describe the difference between the two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="329880">And we're going to reach the conclusion that since there's</span> <span m="331510">only one difference--</span> <span m="333040">one kind of difference with two manifestations to</span> <span m="336250">disappearing support relations, we're going to</span> <span m="338860">conclude that those support relations are important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="344940">And we're going to turn them red</span> <span m="348830">because they're so important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="351140">And we're going to change the name from "support" to "must</span> <span m="354640">support."</span> <span m="360130">So this is our new model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="362250">This is an evolving model that now is decorated with</span> <span m="365380">information about what's important.</span> </p>
<p><span m="367590">So if you're going to match something against this model,</span> <span m="370570">it must be the case that those support relations are there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="372700">If it's not there-- if they're not there, it's not an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="375960">All right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="377750">So we've learned something definite</span> <span m="379830">from a single example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="381070">This is not 10,000 trials.</span> </p>
<p><span m="383330">This is a teacher presenting something to the student and</span> <span m="386490">the student learning something immediately in one step about</span> <span m="390040">what's important in an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="393740">So let's do it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="394550">That was so much fun.</span> </p>
<p><span m="396580">Let's do this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="400930">Same as before except that now when we describe this thing,</span> <span m="405970">there are some additional relations--</span> <span m="408880">these relations, and those are touch relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="414860">So now when we compare that--</span> <span m="417310">is that an arch?</span> </p>
<p><span m="418340">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="419360">It's a near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="425720">When we compare that near miss with our evolving model, we</span> <span m="429370">see immediately that once again there's exactly one</span> <span m="432210">difference, two</span> <span m="433580">manifestations, the touch relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="436190">So we can immediately conclude that these touch relations are</span> <span m="439650">interfering with our belief that this could be an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="443490">So what do we do with that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="445330">We put those together again and we build</span> <span m="448210">ourselves a new model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="450680">It's much like the old model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="453730">It still has the imperatives up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="456920">We have to have the support relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="459159">But now down here-- and we draw not signs through there--</span> <span m="462740">these are must not touch relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="469500">So now you can't match against that model if those two side</span> <span m="472300">supports are touching each other.</span> </p>
<p><span m="475360">So in just two steps, we've learned two important things</span> <span m="477630">about what has to be in place in order for this thing to be</span> <span m="480780">construed to be an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="481720">So our martian is making great progress.</span> </p>
<p><span m="484160">But our martian isn't through, because there's some more</span> <span m="485860">things we might want it to know about</span> <span m="488210">the nature of arches.</span> </p>
<p><span m="490170">For example, we might present it with this one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="496510">Well, that looks just like our initial example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="499830">It's an example just like our initial example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="504720">But this time the top has been painted red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="509360">And I'm still saying that that's an arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="512380">So once again, there's only one difference and that</span> <span m="515490">difference is that in the description of this object, we</span> <span m="522570">have the additional information that the color of</span> <span m="527330">the top is red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="530480">And we've been carrying along without saying so, that the</span> <span m="533000">color of the top in the evolving model is white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="540920">So now we know that the top doesn't have to be white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="543900">It can be either red or white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546920">So we'll put those two together and</span> <span m="549480">we'll get a new model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="551600">And that new model this time once again</span> <span m="554440">will have three parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="556600">It will have the relations, an imperative form that we've</span> <span m="560380">been carrying along now, the must support and the must not</span> <span m="563760">touch, but now we're going to turn that color relation</span> <span m="567220">itself into an imperative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="569520">And we're going to say that the top has to be</span> <span m="571280">either red or white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="580290">So now, once again, in one step we've learned something</span> <span m="582330">definite about archness.</span> </p>
<p><span m="584540">Two more steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="586300">Suppose now we present it with this example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="594400">It's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="599670">And this time there's going to be a little paint</span> <span m="602030">added here as well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="604020">This time we're going to have the top painted blue like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="609790">So the description will be like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="622540">And now we have to somehow put that together with our</span> <span m="624520">evolving model to make a new model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="626620">And there's some choices here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="628080">And our choice depends somewhat on the nature of the</span> <span m="630640">world that we're working in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="633000">So suppose we're working in flag world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="635990">There are only three colors--</span> <span m="637080">red, white, and blue.</span> </p>
<p><span m="639410">Now we've seen them all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="641590">If we've seen them all, then what we're going to do is</span> <span m="644700">we're going to say that the evolving model now is adjusted</span> <span m="648220">yet again like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="653250">Oh-- but those are imperatives still.</span> </p>
<p><span m="654690">Let me carry that along.</span> </p>
<p><span m="661230">At this time, this guy--</span> <span m="663110">the color relation--</span> <span m="665790">goes out here to anything at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="669960">So we could have just not drawn it at all, but then we</span> <span m="672660">would have lost track of the fact that we've actually</span> <span m="674510">learned that anything can be there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="676260">So we're going to retain the relation but have it point to</span> <span m="678290">the "anything goes" marker.</span> </p>
<p><span m="681620">Well, we're making great progress and I said there's</span> <span m="683170">just one more thing to go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="685480">So let me compress that into this area here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="689640">What I'm going to add this time is I'm going to say that</span> <span m="694400">the example is like everything you've seen before except that</span> <span m="706320">the top is now one of those kinds of child's bricks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="712510">So you have a choice actually about whether this</span> <span m="715280">is an arch or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="716840">But if I say, yeah, it's still an arch, then we'd add a</span> <span m="720710">little something to its description.</span> </p>
<p><span m="722130">So this description would look like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="725080">Same things that we've seen before in terms of support,</span> <span m="728260">but now we'd have a relation that says that</span> <span m="729950">this top is a wedge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="737260">And over here--</span> <span m="738460">something we've been carrying along but not writing down--</span> <span m="741220">this top is a block.</span> </p>
<p><span m="743640">A brick, I guess in the language of the day.</span> </p>
<p><span m="748600">So if we say that it can be either a wedge or a brick on</span> <span m="751800">top, what do we do with that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="754390">Once again, it depends on the nature of representation, but</span> <span m="757430">if we say that we have a representation, that has a</span> <span m="759980">hierarchy of parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762000">So bricks and wedges are both children's blocks and</span> <span m="765500">children's box or toys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="767760">Then we can think of drawing in a little bit of that</span> <span m="769830">hierarchy right here and saying well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="775090">Immediately above that we've got the brick or wedge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="786000">And a little bit above that we've got block.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790600">And a little bit above that we've got toy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="794190">And a little bit above that we eventually get to</span> <span m="795980">any physical object.</span> </p>
<p><span m="798060">So what does it do in response to that kind of situation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="804480">You have the choice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="805440">But what the program I'm speaking of actually did was</span> <span m="808830">to make a conservative generalization up here just to</span> <span m="811750">say that it's one of those guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="816140">So once again it's learned something definite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="818280">Let me see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="818680">Let me count the steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="820590">One, two, three, four, five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="830950">And I just learned four things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="833780">So the generalization of a color, it took two steps to</span> <span m="836290">get all the way up to "don't care."</span> <span m="839300">So note how it contrasts with anything you've seen in a</span> <span m="842460">neural net.</span> </p>
<p><span m="844840">Or anything you will see downstream in some of the</span> <span m="846990">other learning techniques that we'll be talking about that</span> <span m="849280">involve using thousands of samples to learn what it is--</span> <span m="853000">to learn whatever it is that is intended to be learned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="859030">Let me show you another example of how these</span> <span m="861890">heuristics can be put to work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="877280">So there are two sets of drawings.</span> </p>
<p><span m="880510">We have the upper set and the lower set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="883110">And your task, you smart humans working in vast</span> <span m="886360">parallelism, your task is to give me a description of the</span> <span m="890100">top trains that distinguishes and separates them from the</span> <span m="893740">trains on the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="909540">You got it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="914740">Nobody's got it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="916690">Well, let me try one on you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="918920">The top trains all have a short car with a closed top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="925010">So how is it possible that a computer could have</span> <span m="927235">figured that out?</span> </p>
<p><span m="929450">It turns out that it figured it out with much the same</span> <span m="931380">apparatus that I've shown you here in connection with the</span> <span m="933220">arches, just deployed in a somewhat different manner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="937640">In this particular case, the examples are presented one at</span> <span m="940680">a time by a teacher who's eager for</span> <span m="943750">the student to learn.</span> </p>
<p><span m="945610">In this case, the examples are presented all at once and the</span> <span m="949950">machine is expected to figure out a description that</span> <span m="952720">separates the two groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955820">And here's how it works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="961950">What you do is you start with one of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="976210">But you have a lot of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="977570">You have some examples--</span> <span m="978530">we'll call the examples on top the "plus examples" and the</span> <span m="981700">examples on the bottom the "negative examples." So the</span> <span m="988500">first thing that you do is you pick one of the positive</span> <span m="991020">examples to work with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="993810">Anybody got any good guesses about what we're</span> <span m="995790">going to call that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="997640">Yeah, you do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="998480">We're going to call that the seed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1002310">It's just highly reminiscent of what we did last time when</span> <span m="1005770">we were doing [? phonology ?]</span> <span m="1006790">but now at a much different level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1008785">We're going to pick one of those guys to be the seed, and</span> <span m="1011350">then we're going to take these heuristics and we're going to</span> <span m="1015000">search for one that loosens this description so that it</span> <span m="1018690">covers more of the positives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020510">You see, if you have a seed that is exactly a description</span> <span m="1023390">of a particular thing and you insist that everything be just</span> <span m="1027010">like that, then nothing will match except itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1030750">But you can use these heuristics to expand the</span> <span m="1034098">coverage of the description, to loosen it so that it covers</span> <span m="1037800">more of the positives.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1039540">So in your first step you might cover, for example, that</span> <span m="1044700">group of objects.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1046810">Too bad for your side, you've also in that particular case</span> <span m="1050860">included a negative example in your description, but perhaps</span> <span m="1054600">in this next step beyond that you'll get to the point where</span> <span m="1058070">you've eliminated all of those negative examples and zeroed</span> <span m="1062020">in on all the positive examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066160">So how might a program be constructed that would do that</span> <span m="1069810">sort of thing?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1070500">Well, think about the choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1072140">The first choice that you have it is to pick a positive</span> <span m="1077920">example to be the seed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1083650">And once you've picked a particular example to be the</span> <span m="1085880">seed, then you can apply heuristics, all of them that</span> <span m="1089350">you have, to make a new description that may cover the</span> <span m="1092820">data better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1093530">It may have more of the positives and fewer of the</span> <span m="1095350">negatives than in your previous step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1099150">But this, if you have a lot of heuristics, and these are a</span> <span m="1103880">lot of heuristics because there's a lot of description</span> <span m="1105850">in that set of trains, there are lots of possible things</span> <span m="1109250">that you could do with those heuristics because you could</span> <span m="1111100">apply them anywhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1112820">So this tree is extremely large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1119870">So what do you do to keep it under control?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1123080">Well, now you have answers to questions like that by</span> <span m="1126240">knee-jerk, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1127480">The branching factor is too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1129680">You want to keep a few solutions going.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1132810">You have some way of measuring how well you're doing so you</span> <span m="1135700">can use a beam search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1139130">This piece here was originally worked out by a friend of</span> <span m="1142880">mine, now, alas, deceased, [? Rashad ?]</span> <span m="1144930">[? Malkowski ?]</span> <span m="1145610">when he was at the University of Illinois.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1147000">And of course, he wasn't interested in toy trains, he</span> <span m="1149355">was just interested in soybean diseases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1152150">And so this exact program was used to build descriptions of</span> <span m="1156080">soybean diseases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1156960">It turned out to be better than the</span> <span m="1158170">plant pathology books.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1163920">We now have two ways of deploying the same heuristics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1167200">But my vocabulary is in need of enrichment, because I'm</span> <span m="1173210">talking about "those" heuristics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1175880">And one of the nice things that [? Malkowski ?]</span> <span m="1178010">did for me a long time ago is give each of them a name.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1181490">So here are the names that were developed by</span> <span m="1185160">[? Malkowski. ?]</span> <span m="1186510">What's happening here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1187240">You're going from an original model to an understanding--</span> <span m="1192430">some things are essential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1194550">So he called this the "require link" heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1203590">And here in the next step, we're forbidding some things</span> <span m="1206860">from being there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1208290">So [? Malkowski ?]</span> <span m="1209070">called that heuristic the "forbid link" heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1217310">And in the next step, we're saying it can be</span> <span m="1219080">either red or white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1220500">So we have a set of colors and we're extending it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1229400">And over here in this heuristic, going from red or</span> <span m="1233010">white to anything goes, that's essentially forgetting about</span> <span m="1237090">color altogether, so we're going to call that "drop link"</span> <span m="1242250">even though for reasons of keeping track, we don't</span> <span m="1245680">actually get rid of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1246420">We just have it pointing to the "anything" marker.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1250210">And finally, in this last step, what we're doing with</span> <span m="1254950">this tree of categories is we're climbing up it one step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1260090">So he called that the "climb tree" heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1265070">So now we have a vocabulary of things we can do in the</span> <span m="1267670">learning process, and having that vocabulary gives us power</span> <span m="1271950">over it, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1272470">Because those are names.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1274130">We can now say, well, what you need here is</span> <span m="1275686">the "drop link" heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1277360">And what you need over there is the "extend set" heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282910">So now I want to back up yet another time and</span> <span m="1285860">say, well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1288850">When we were working with that phonology stuff, all I did was</span> <span m="1290870">generalize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1291350">Are we just generalizing here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1294090">No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1295560">We're both generalizing and specializing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1298780">So when I say that the links over here that are developed</span> <span m="1303520">in our first step are essential, this is a</span> <span m="1308050">specialization step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314760">And when I say they can't be--</span> <span m="1317560">they cannot be touch relations, that's a</span> <span m="1319880">specialization step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1324880">Because we're able to match fewer and fewer things when we</span> <span m="1328480">say you can't have touch relations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1331090">But over here, when I go here and say, well, it doesn't have</span> <span m="1333940">to be white.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1334640">It can also be red.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1337220">That's a generalization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1341280">Now we can match more things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1343970">And when I drop the link altogether, that's a</span> <span m="1347210">generalization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1351170">And when I climb the tree, that's a generalization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1360150">And that's why when I do this notional picture of what</span> <span m="1364770">happens when [? Malkowski ?]</span> <span m="1366030">program does a tree search to find a solution to the train</span> <span m="1368380">problem, they're both specialization steps which</span> <span m="1371680">draw in the number of things that can be matched, and</span> <span m="1373740">generalization steps that make it broader.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1378180">So, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380670">We've also got the notion of near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1385530">And we've got the notion of example--</span> <span m="1387220">some of these things are examples,</span> <span m="1388450">some are near misses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1389890">We've got generalization specialization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1393090">Does one go with one or the other, or are they all mixed</span> <span m="1397290">up in their relationship to each other?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399330">Can you generalize and specialize with near misses?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1402490">What do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1404310">You think--</span> <span m="1405570">you don't think so, [INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1407146">What do you think?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1408132">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m="1409611">specialization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410104">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: [INAUDIBLE] lead to</span> <span m="1411090">specialization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1412569">Let's see if that's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415050">So we've got specialization here, and that's a near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1419380">We've got specialization here, and that's a near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1424050">We've got generalization here, and that's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1429430">And we've got generalization here, and that's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1433540">And we've got generalization here, and that's an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1436550">So [INAUDIBLE] has got that one nailed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1439000">The examples always generalize, and the near</span> <span m="1441650">misses always specialize.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1442910">So we've got apparatuses in place that allow us to both</span> <span m="1445580">expand what we could match and shrink what we could match.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1450910">So what has this got to do anything?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1452380">Well, which one of these methods is better, by the way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1456260">This one--</span> <span m="1457920">this one requires a teacher to organize everything up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1460780">This one can handle it in batch mode.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466320">This one is the sort of thing you would need to do with a</span> <span m="1469600">human because we don't have much memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1471900">That one is the sort of thing that a computer's good at</span> <span m="1473970">because it has lots of memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1475790">So which one's better?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1478690">Well, it depends on what you're trying to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1481010">If you're trying to build a machine that analyzes the</span> <span m="1484425">stock market, you might want to go that way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1486610">Or soybean diseases, or any one of a variety</span> <span m="1490540">of practical problems.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1491290">If you're trying to model people, then maybe this is a</span> <span m="1494440">way that deserves additional merit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1497690">How do you get all that sorted out?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1499450">Well, one way to get it all sorted out is to talk in terms</span> <span m="1503840">of what are sometimes called "felicity conditions." So when</span> <span m="1512875">I talk about felicity conditions, I'm talking about</span> <span m="1514570">a teacher and a student and covenants that</span> <span m="1516980">hold between them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518710">So here's the teacher.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1526100">That's me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1529090">And here's the student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1533980">That's you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1537270">And the objective of interaction is to transform an</span> <span m="1544200">initial state of knowledge into a new state of knowledge</span> <span m="1557560">so that the student is smarter and able to make use of that</span> <span m="1564465">new knowledge to do things that couldn't be done before</span> <span m="1571565">by the student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1573950">So the student over here has a learner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582150">And he has something that uses what is learned.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1589310">And the teacher over here has a style.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1594890">So if any learning is to take place, one side has to know</span> <span m="1599720">something about the other side.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602230">For example, it's helpful if the teacher understands the</span> <span m="1612440">initial state of the student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1615200">And here's one way of thinking about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636830">You can think of what you know as forming a kind of network.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1640350">So initially, you don't know anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643750">But as you learn, you start</span> <span m="1646780">developing quanta of knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1657620">And these quanta of knowledge are all linked together by</span> <span m="1660360">prerequisite relationships that might indicate how you</span> <span m="1664410">get from one quantum to another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1667130">So maybe you have generalization links, maybe</span> <span m="1669200">you have specialization links, maybe you have combination</span> <span m="1671560">links, but you can think of what you know as forming this</span> <span m="1674420">kind of network.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1676590">Now your state of knowledge at any particular time can then</span> <span m="1679640">be viewed as a kind of wavefront in that space.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1684700">So if I, the teacher, know where your wavefront is, can I</span> <span m="1688020">do a better job of teaching you stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690990">Sure, for this reason.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1693510">Suppose you make a mistake, m1, that depends on q1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700130">Way, way behind your wavefront.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1702600">What do I do if I know that you made a</span> <span m="1704230">mistake of that kind?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1706935">Oh, I just say, oh, you forgot you need a semicolon after</span> <span m="1710620">that kind of statement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1712450">I just remind you of something that you certainly know, you</span> <span m="1714710">just overlooked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1716560">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1717720">On the other hand, suppose you make a mistake that depends on</span> <span m="1722030">a piece of knowledge way out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1724620">That kind of mistake, m2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1726590">What do I say to you then?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1730075">What do you think, Patrick?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1732480">What do you think I would say if you made</span> <span m="1733245">that kind of mistake?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1735021">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1736969">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: No.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1737943">That's not what I would say [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742813">STUDENT: You'd tell us that we don't know that yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1745248">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: I would say something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1747196">What [INAUDIBLE] suggested I would say.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1750140">Oh, don't worry about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1752470">We'll get to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753420">We're not ready for it yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755770">So in this case, I remind somebody of something they</span> <span m="1759030">already know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1760360">In this case, I tell them they'll learn about it later.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1763370">So what do I do with mistake number three?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1767550">That's the learning moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1769710">That's where I can push the wavefront out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1771960">Because everything's in place to learn the</span> <span m="1773550">stuff at the next radius.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1776770">So if I know that the student has made a mistake on that</span> <span m="1778770">wavefront, that's when I say, this is the teaching moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1781490">This is when I explain something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1783500">So that's why it's important for the teacher to have a good</span> <span m="1788290">model of where the student is in the</span> <span m="1792860">initial state of knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1796910">Next thing that's important for the teacher to know is the</span> <span m="1800970">way that the student learns.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1803220">Because if the student is a computer, they can handle the</span> <span m="1805290">stuff in batch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1806030">That's one thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1807280">If the student is a third grader who has a limited</span> <span m="1810810">capacity to store stuff, then that makes a difference in how</span> <span m="1814880">you teach it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1815370">You might teach it that way to the third grader, and that</span> <span m="1819260">way, buried underneath this board, to a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823080">So you need to understand the way that the learner--</span> <span m="1825810">the computational capacity of the learner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1830130">And there's also a need to understand the computational</span> <span m="1832610">capacity of the user box down there, because sometimes you</span> <span m="1838160">can be taught stuff that you can't actually use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1842120">So by now, most of you have attempted to read that</span> <span m="1844550">sentence up there, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1846920">And it seems screwy, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1849690">It seems unintelligible, perhaps?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1852970">It's a garden path sentence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1854350">It makes perfectly good English, but the way you</span> <span m="1857750">generally read it, it doesn't, because you have a limited</span> <span m="1860300">buffer in your language processor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864580">What does this mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1866000">You're expecting this to be "to." Question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1870130">But it's actually a command.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1871680">Here's the deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1872820">Somebody's got to give the students their grades.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1875560">Well, we can have their parents do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1878700">Have the grades given to their students by</span> <span m="1881650">their parents, then.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1883340">So it's a command.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884180">And you garden path on it, because you have limited</span> <span m="1885970">buffer space in your language processor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1888230">So with parentheses you can understand it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1891310">You can learn about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1892520">You can see that it's good English, but you can't</span> <span m="1894150">generally process that kind of sentence without going back</span> <span m="1898100">and starting over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1900450">And what about going the other way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1902140">Are there covenants that we have to have here that involve</span> <span m="1905670">the student understanding some things about the teacher?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1908900">Well, first thing there is is trust.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1912210">The student has to presume that the teacher is teaching</span> <span m="1914690">the student correct information,</span> <span m="1917420">not lying to student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1920460">Ratified that you're all here because presumably you all</span> <span m="1922700">think that I'm not trying to screw you by telling you stuff</span> <span m="1925700">that's a lie.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1927540">There's also this sort of thing down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1930990">Understanding of the teacher's style.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1933440">So you might say, well, professor x, all he does is</span> <span m="1935590">read slides to us in class, so why go?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1938230">You wouldn't be entirely misadvised.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1939760">That's an understanding of one kind of style.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1942530">Or you can say, well, old Winston, he tries to tell us</span> <span m="1944620">something definite and convey a family of powerful ideas in</span> <span m="1949040">every class.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1949830">So maybe it's worth dragging yourself out of bed at 10</span> <span m="1951590">o'clock in the morning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1952850">Those are style issues, and those are things that the</span> <span m="1955850">student uses to determine how to match the student's style</span> <span m="1959500">against that of the instructor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1963370">So that helps us to interpret or think about differences in</span> <span m="1968330">style so that we can appreciate whether we ought to</span> <span m="1971010">be learning that way, where that way is the way that's</span> <span m="1976800">underneath down here, the way you would teach a computer,</span> <span m="1979520">the way [? Malkowski ?]</span> <span m="1980970">taught a computer about soybean diseases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1983600">We can do it that way, or we can do it this way with a</span> <span m="1988090">teacher who deliberately organizes and shapes the</span> <span m="1990570">learning sequence for the benefit of a student who has a</span> <span m="1994150">limited processing capability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1998260">Now you're humans, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1999680">So think about what the machine has to do here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2002910">The machine--</span> <span m="2003570">in order to learn anything definite in each of those</span> <span m="2006380">steps, the machine has to build a description.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2009490">So it has to describe the examples to itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2012410">That's unquestioned, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2013450">Because what it's doing is looking at the differences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2016460">So it can't look at the differences unless it's got</span> <span m="2018420">descriptions of things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2022480">So if you're like the machine, then you can't learn anything</span> <span m="2026630">unless you build descriptions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2029200">Unless you talk to yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033140">And if you talk to yourself, you're building the kind of</span> <span m="2036030">descriptions that make it possible for</span> <span m="2038340">you to do the learning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040850">And you say to me, I'm an MIT student.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2044220">I want to see the numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2046640">So let me show you the numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048040">And when I'm going to show numbers--</span> <span m="2050290">the numbers that I'm going to show you show you the virtues</span> <span m="2052400">of talking to yourself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055600">So here's the experiment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2058190">The experiment was done by a friend of mine, Michelene Chi.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2061750">Always seems to go by the name Mickey Chi.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2078130">There he is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079460">So here's the deal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2080340">The students that she worked with were expected to learn</span> <span m="2084580">about elementary physics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2085989">801 type stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2088060">And she took eight subjects, and she had them--</span> <span m="2092719">she took them through a bunch of examples and then she gave</span> <span m="2094820">them an examination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2097220">So eight subjects, and so they divide into two groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2101400">The bottom half and the top half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2103890">The ones who did better than average and the ones who did</span> <span m="2106750">worse than average.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2109320">So then you can say, well, OK, what did that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2112740">You can say, how much did they talk to themselves?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2114940">Well, that was measured by having them talk out loud as</span> <span m="2117680">they solved the problems on an examination.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2120800">So we could ask how much self explanation was done by the</span> <span m="2125440">smart ones versus the less smart ones?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2128470">And here are the results.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2130830">The worst ones-- the worst four said about 10 things to</span> <span m="2134620">themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2136390">The best four said about 35 things to themselves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2142530">That's a pretty dramatic difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2144470">Here's the data in a more straightforward form.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2148290">This, by the way, points out that the smart ones scored</span> <span m="2150840">twice as high as the less smart ones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2154870">And when we look at the number of explanations they gave</span> <span m="2156870">themselves in two categories, smart ones said three times as</span> <span m="2161760">much stuff to themselves as the less smart ones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164460">So, as you can see, the explanations break down into</span> <span m="2167760">two groups.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2169170">Some have to do with monitoring and not with</span> <span m="2173770">physics at all.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174760">They're things like, oh hell, I'm stuck.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178010">Or, I don't know what to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2182250">And the others have to do with physics.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2184490">Things like, well, maybe I should draw a force diagram.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2187550">Or let me write down f equals ma, or something like that, as</span> <span m="2192340">physics knowledge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2194200">I think it's interesting that this average score is</span> <span m="2197975">different by a factor of two, and the average talking to</span> <span m="2201080">oneself differed by a factor of three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2204580">Now this isn't quite there, because what's not clear is if</span> <span m="2209280">you encourage somebody to talk to themself, and they talk to</span> <span m="2211900">themselves more than they would have ordinarily, does</span> <span m="2214570">that make them score better?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215770">All we know is that the ones who talk to themselves more do</span> <span m="2218280">score better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219890">But anecdotally, talking to some veterans of 6.034,</span> <span m="2224510">they've started talking to themselves more when they</span> <span m="2226240">solve problems, and they think that it makes them smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2231830">Now I would caution you not to do this too much in public.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236490">Because people can get the wrong idea if you talk to</span> <span m="2238590">yourself too much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2239430">But it does seem--</span> <span m="2242350">it does, in fact, seem to help.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2249270">Now what I did last time is I told you how</span> <span m="2252260">to be a good scientist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2253750">What I'm telling you now is how to make yourself smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2255890">And I want to conclude this hour by telling you about how</span> <span m="2258160">you can package your ideas so that they have greater impact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2262670">So I guess I could have said, how to make yourself more</span> <span m="2265720">famous, but I've limited myself to saying how to</span> <span m="2269430">package your ideas better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2270570">And the reason you want to package your ideas better is</span> <span m="2273010">because if you package your ideas better than the next</span> <span m="2275260">slug, then you're going to get the faculty position and</span> <span m="2277630">they're not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2279130">If you say to me, I'm going to be an</span> <span m="2280050">entrepreneur, same thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282310">You're going to get the venture capitalist money and</span> <span m="2283950">the next slug won't if you package your ideas better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2287580">So this little piece of work on the arch business got a</span> <span m="2290920">whole lot more famous than I ever expected.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293600">I did it when I was young and stupid, and didn't have any</span> <span m="2296310">idea what qualities might emerge from a piece of work</span> <span m="2299400">that would make it well known.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2301240">I only figured it out much later.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2303160">But in retrospect, it has five qualities that you can think</span> <span m="2309310">about when you're deciding whether your packaging of your</span> <span m="2311950">idea is in a form that will lead to that idea becoming</span> <span m="2317240">well known.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2319490">And since there are five of them, it's convenient to put</span> <span m="2323340">them all on the points of a star like so.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2331520">So quality number one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2335790">I've made these all into s-words just to make them</span> <span m="2337870">easier to remember.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2339720">Quality number one is that there's some kind of symbol</span> <span m="2343390">associated with a work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345270">Some kind of visual handle that people will use to</span> <span m="2349560">remember your idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2351760">So what's the visual symbol here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354890">Well, that's astonishingly easy to figure out, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2357200">That's the arch.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2359140">For years without my intending it, this</span> <span m="2361110">was called arch learning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2364670">So you need a symbol.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2366840">Then you also need a slogan.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2375940">That's a kind of verbal handle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2377820">It doesn't explain the idea, but it's enough of a handle</span> <span m="2381180">to, as Minsky would say, put you back in the mental state</span> <span m="2385280">you were in when you understood the idea in the</span> <span m="2386920">first place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2388540">So what is the slogan for this work?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2391430">Anybody have any ideas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393760">Pretty obvious.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2396745">What's essential to this process working?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2399727">The ability to present an example is very similar</span> <span m="2402212">[INAUDIBLE], that constitutes a model but</span> <span m="2405616">isn't one of those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2406820">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407310">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So it's a near miss.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2417620">The next thing you need if your work is going to become</span> <span m="2419700">well known is a surprise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2429550">What's the surprise with this stuff?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432180">Well, the surprise--</span> <span m="2433050">everything that had been done in artificial intelligence</span> <span m="2435310">having to do with learning before this time was</span> <span m="2437800">precursors to neural nets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2440120">Thousands of examples to learn anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442490">So the big surprise was that it was possible for a machine</span> <span m="2446410">to learn something definite from each of the examples.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2449950">So that now goes by the name of one shot learning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2453810">That was the surprise, that a computer could learn something</span> <span m="2455890">definite from a single example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2459680">So let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2460120">We've almost completed our star.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2463630">But there are more points on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2465120">So this point is the salient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470530">What's a salient--</span> <span m="2472680">what's a salient idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2476400">Jose, do you know what a salient idea is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2480912">He's too shy to tell me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2484800">What's a salient idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2487716">Ah, who said important?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490065">Wrong answer, but very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2491550">You're not shy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494025">So what does it really mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2495510">Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2496500">STUDENT: Relative to what somebody's</span> <span m="2497490">already thinking about?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2499470">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Relative to what somebody's</span> <span m="2500955">thinking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2501450">Not quite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2508380">If you have a--</span> <span m="2510360">if you're an expert in--</span> <span m="2513825">yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514815">STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2516300">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Really close.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2516795">We're getting closer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2520260">[INAUDIBLE].</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521250">Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2521745">STUDENT: Maybe an idea that wasn't obviously apparent, but</span> <span m="2524467">becomes apparent gradually as somebody starts to understand?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528740">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: We're zeroing-- we're circling</span> <span m="2529660">the wagons here and zeroing in on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2532040">Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2532978">STUDENT: If I'm preempting what you're about to say, it</span> <span m="2535730">has sort of a doorway of how you can understand the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539455">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: It's what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539954">Sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2540453">STUDENT: It's sort of like a doorway of how you</span> <span m="2542948">can grasp the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2546940">PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: That's sort if it, too, but if</span> <span m="2549250">you study military history, what's the salient on a fort?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2556020">Well, this is a good word to have in your vocabulary</span> <span m="2558090">because it sort of means all of those things, but what it</span> <span m="2561850">really means is something that sticks out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2564850">So on a fort, if this were a fort, these would all be</span> <span m="2568660">salients because they stick out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2571380">So the salient idea is usually important</span> <span m="2574020">because it sticks out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2575870">But it's not-- the meaning is not "important," the meaning</span> <span m="2577780">is "stick out."</span> <span m="2579300">So a piece of work becomes more famous if it has</span> <span m="2582180">something that sticks out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2584130">It's interesting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2584930">There are theses that have been written at MIT that have</span> <span m="2586840">too many good ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2590190">And how can have too many good ideas?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2592160">Well, you can have too many good ideas if no one idea</span> <span m="2595170">rises above and becomes the idea that people think about</span> <span m="2598120">when they think about you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2600310">We have people on the faculty who would have been more</span> <span m="2602130">famous if their theses had fewer ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2604280">It's amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2606530">So this piece of work did have a salient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2609670">And the salient idea was that you could get one shot</span> <span m="2613390">learning via the use of near misses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2618920">That was the salient idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2621290">The fifth thing, ah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2624660">Talk more about this in my "How to</span> <span m="2627600">Speak" lecture in January.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2628960">The fifth thing I like people to try to incorporate into</span> <span m="2631950">their presentations is a story.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2637000">Because we humans somehow love stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2640290">We love people to tell us stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2641610">We love things to be packaged in stories.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2643260">And believe me, I think all of education is essentially about</span> <span m="2646920">storytelling and story understanding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2649850">So if you want your idea to be sold to the venture</span> <span m="2652480">capitalist, if you want to get the faculty job, if you want</span> <span m="2656850">to get your book sold to a publisher, if you want to sell</span> <span m="2659940">something to a customer, ask yourself if your presentation</span> <span m="2663720">has these qualities in it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2665300">And if it has all of those things, it's a lot more likely</span> <span m="2668230">to be effective than it doesn't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670120">And you'll end up being famous.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2671550">Now you say to me, well, being famous-- that sounds like the</span> <span m="2675030">Sloan School type of concept.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2678020">Isn't it immoral to want to be famous?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2682570">Maybe that's a decision you can make.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2685270">But whenever I think about the question, I somehow think of</span> <span m="2690880">the idea that your ideas are like your children.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2692730">You want to be sure that they have the best life possible.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696050">So if they're not packaged well, they won't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2699390">I'm also reminded of an evening I spent at a soiree</span> <span m="2706670">with Julia Child.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2710400">Julia, and there's me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2714600">And I have no idea how come I got to sit</span> <span m="2716770">next to Julia Child.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2717700">I think they thought I was one of the rich Winstons.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2720600">The Winston flowers, or the Harry Winston diamonds or</span> <span m="2723250">something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2723960">There I was, sitting next to Julia Child.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2726700">And the interesting thing--</span> <span m="2727940">by the way, did you notice I'm now telling a story?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2731379">The interesting thing about this experience was that there</span> <span m="2736120">was a constant flow of people--</span> <span m="2742760">happened to be all women--</span> <span m="2744410">people going past Ms. Child saying how wonderful she was</span> <span m="2749430">to have made such an enormous change in their life.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2752840">Must have been 10 of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2753340">It was amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754190">Just steady flow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2756250">So eventually I leaned over to her and I said, Ms. Child, is</span> <span m="2760730">it fun to be famous?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2763130">And she thought about it a second and said,</span> <span m="2765930">you get used to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2768360">And that had a profound effect on me, because you always say,</span> <span m="2771380">well, what's the opposite like?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2773810">Is it fun to be ignored?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2775330">And the answer is, no, it's not much fun to be ignored.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2780950">So yeah, it's something you can get used to, but you can</span> <span m="2783990">never get used to having your stuff ignored, especially if</span> <span m="2787180">it's good stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2788610">So that's why I commend to you this business</span> <span m="2790270">about packaging ideas.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2792160">And now you see that 6034 is not just about AI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2794770">It's about how to do good science.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2796140">It's how to make yourself smarter, and how to make</span> <span m="2798220">yourself more famous.</span> </p>
